Human brains are lazy engines. They almost always choose the “shortest” way to go from point A to point B. 

When writing code it goes like this: 
✅write code
😢encounter error
😬modify code
😡encounter error
😎go to StackOverflow
🥳copy code
😏run code
🥶repeat.

…this is no where near from effiency! 

When you avoid reading the documentation, you’re missing out on understanding the bigger picture and the deeper mechanical processes behind your code.

This leads to writing less efficient code.

I know because I’ve being doing it recently with Plotly Dash library.

😩Everything was right here, in the docs, but my brain was too lazy to read the details and understand the situation.

Do you relate?

Btw we worked with Shloka Gupta on a nice rework of https://docs.naas.ai so if you want to get started, I suggest you start there 🏁😉

PS: the good thing is all the templates are available in naas docs, just click on “open in naas” button and get things done ✔️

Every day, I tried to share my learnings about data, product management, open source community building and sustainability.

I tried to put together different kind of content: 
→ Informative 🚨
→ Inspirational 👌
→ Provocative 😜
→ Entertaining 🤣

I really enjoyed the process of documenting my journey and sharing it with the world. I see a lot of value in content creation and I really enjoy the process of writing.

I feel honored that people like Ethan Aaron, Mehdi Ouazza, Zain Daniyal 📊 have shared my name in their list of data content creator to follow 🙏

To schedule your Jupyter Notebook using Papermill in naas.ai, you just need to add this simple formula👇.

import naas
naas.scheduler.add(cron=""0 * * * *"") ← this cron argument is the standard syntax worldwide. It means every hour in that case.

Press play ▶️ and your notebook will be sent to the Naas ""⚡️Production folder"".

Every time your notebook is executed, a record will be stored in this folder so you can access it if it fails.

But they also have their downsides....

...if you don't use them properly. 

My take is that it's about how we use notebooks, the notebooks are not responsible for bad coding habits. 

They are very permissive by nature, so if you are not rigorous, they can be very dirty, and I hate it. 😡

At naas.ai we are going way beyond notebooks, inspired by the work done at Netflix. 

We believe in clean, well formatted, versioned Notebooks that can be used as building blocks to create a generation of data products where code, documentation and execution live at the same place.

That's why we are building the biggest catalog of notebooks templates ever with our community (Check our GitHub repo in the comment)

→ If you are interested in the subject, here is a 20min conversation I had with Mehdi Ouazza a couple of weeks ago. 

Like a lot of people in data, he has a love and hate relationship with notebooks, but you will see that we agree on many points.

If you did not see my previous posts, this summer, we are building dashboards using open source toolkits like Plotly. 

Mine is on earth data. I call it “World situation room”

One mantra is at the center of that project:

“Start by the user experience and work backward to technology.” like Jobs was saying. 🍏

This means I need first to think about charts, layout, readability, responsiveness, code the front-end with placeholders and only when I’m done, integrate the data. 


This means… I iterate a lot, copy pasting snippets of code and bundle them together to keep only a few lines at the end.

It tough, but that’s ok, I’m learning a lot in the process 👌🙃

The dashboard we are building will become open source templates available on naas.ai repository on the end. 

If you want to participate to the project, just comment and we will onboard you!

When you open somebody’s Github profile, one of the things you may want to look at is their contribution graph. 

The contribution graph is not a tool to assess a developer’s qualification by any means. 
But it is a good way to show how much you are committed to creating or contributing to open source projects.(Private repos are not counted)

What I read behind the lines here is an intent to create a digital asset for GitHub users, like a trophy 🏆. I think it makes sense to try things like this in the Web3/Metaverse world.

→ Do you find this interesting?

→ If you want to generate it on your profile, there should be a ""NEW! View your contributions in 3D, VR and IRL"" CTA right below you contribution graph.

Let me explain👇

In the current market dynamics 📉, we need to find a way of eliminating waste from data operations to create sustainable data products.

Where the only thing that matters is the value you deliver. Not the team, not the tool, nothing but the value you deliver.
And this way is called Lean. Like on lean manufacturing.

It is not necessary to collect all data all the time for every single use case. We want our tools to help us explore the true value of data from features, drivers, predictive scores, and more.

The industry is broken and needs fixing. ""Big data"" has created a world full of wasteful practices, we need ""Smart data"".

🙏 We need a data ecosystem that is conscious of this situation and is ready to change. We need to create a culture where open source prevails and techniques are shared with the world openly.

🚀 It's not rocket science. It's just common sense:

1️⃣ Always start with customer understanding (find a problem you're solving)
2️⃣ Identify data sources in potential solutions (eg Google Analytics, CRM data, etc)
3️⃣ Create a clear product backlog with actionable tasks (eg clean your data, reduce maintenance costs).
4️⃣ Create an iterative business model (start testing ideas then build on success)
5️⃣ Learn quickly from what you've built (conduct customer interviews and adjust based on feedback as well as customer behavior)

The core components of the lean data stack are serverless compute, managed services and open source. 

There are no silos in lean data; security and analytics can be integrated to make it an end-to-end stack.

→ There are so many great minds out there working on the topic. I really hope we can get this fixed together, and that the naas.ai open source community and I can be a part of it.

I think we have a pretty good idea of how to make this happen from the feedback of our first customers. cc Joshua Alvernia

Companies need to calm down on data platforms and start building data products instead. 

The job to be done is simple: tap into the leader's brain 🧠 and translate their vision into products.

👇

These products need to be a reflection of the way they want to operate the business and gain a competitive advantage.

These products need to be designed not only to solve internal business problems but also to create new business opportunities. 

These products should have their own P&L, revenue should be obvious, and costs should be transparent.

These products are to be treated as Assets on the balance sheet and be deprecated over time. 

These products cannot be built on top of closed-sourced technologies, they need to rely on open source to ensure full ownership.

These products should be self-sufficient, autonomous, and could be deployed in any context. 


→ I hear a lot of voices rising up in that direction, and I'm excited. 🥳

Because everything stated above is what we have in mind since day 1 with naas.ai, and as the market is now evolving toward this, we are getting ready to go all-in. 

Tomorrow, I will share with you our very first customer story article. I hope it will encourage more companies to bet on our core team, our community, and the power of open source 💚

 Stay tuned.

Today, we learned more about it thanks to Elias Dabbas, our naas.ai community expert on Dash and Marketing data. 

This is a summary of what we talked about: 

→ What makes a dashboard UI: simple navigation and charts, dynamic filtering, reference to a perimeter and a timeframe (a number alone does not mean anything)

→ The importance of domain knowledge to make the right design choices or the need for a ""wireframe"" before starting coding anything

→ The difference between dashboards and apps: dashboards are mainly outputs, they don't send data or instructions to a back-end, apps do.

→ Preprocessing vs post-processing data: many people use dashboarding tools as query engines (post-processing) when they should instead optimize in advance (pre-process) for speed and UX

→ How Dash leverages Bootstrap to create clean layouts very easily, and why using such framework is important to make your dashboards responsive

→ What are the callbacks functions and how they are used to populate charts into the dashboard layouts, but also open the door to very powerful dynamic filtering 

It was such an insightful session, we learned a lot.

Tomorrow, we will start applying this in the context of our summer-dashboarding project on GitHub

I just published a very simple template to do it.

It's just a first step because you can only access it from your cloud account but we will soon make it easy to deploy it to everybody on the web.

Kudos to our community member Elias Dabbas who motivated this and Maxime for figuring out the right way to do it technically.

→ Tomorrow we can start the ""Summer Dashboarding"" project with this very cool feature added on top of our Naas account. 

Curious to learn more or try it yourself?
Just comment below. I will share the template once my PR gets merged tomorrow by the team🤞

Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) is an object storage service that offers scalability, data availability, security, performance and is very cost effective.

It falls into the ""Data Lake"" category of data tools.
= push all your unstructured data into a bucket, and leverage the power of the cloud to make sense of it.

Amazon uses it to run its global e-commerce network,
Netflix uses it as the fabric of their big data ecosystem,
but it can also serve smaller companies.

At naas.ai, we use it to store:
➡️ Events data from our product
➡️ Contents data extracted from social media platforms
➡️ Customers data from multiples sources

It enables us to:
✅ Create our product KPIs
✅ Follow our social media performance through multiple accounts
✅ Enrich our CRM automatically with quality insights

We have created super cool notebook templates to work with it, so feel free to use out (link of the repo in the comment) ⭐️

👉 If you need any help or feedback on how to get the most of working with S3, I'm more than happy to share our experience! 💚

Cheers, and have a nice Sunday!

🏭 When you look at data pipelines, you look at a linear workflow. From point A to point B. 

📦 When you look at data products, things are more complex. Everything is interconnected.

Network visualizations enable anyone to see that. 
They connect the dots. Like neurons.

Cassie Kozyrkov just published a video of her playing with Dalle-2 from OpenAI...and as usual, she developed some very interesting points we need to think of:  

Dalle generates 6 images based on your prompts (a sentence, a few words)

But to get to the final piece, there is a need for iteration with the system. 

These beautiful AI-generated results you can see on the web rarely come from the first shot. 

It's kind of counted as ""AI Made"" but AI is just a useful tool.

It makes no sense to share authorship with your laptop for what you are creating, or your paintbrush 🎨

At the end of the day, YOU, the artist behind the tool, will say ""this is it"" while playing with it.

Do you agree?

We are about to stop our project of building a data product in 1 month (we gave ourselves already +1 week 😇)

⭐️ But look at this, we have 👇

→ a database of 14 reports on key indicators (ex: company page)
→ clean PNGs that you can copy and paste anywhere 
→ option to see a dynamic graph in a new tab 
→ download CSV option 
→ variations displayed month over month in % and value with a sentiment 🔴🟢

Of course, we wanted to do more on Youtube and Twitter. 
But it requires more weeks of work. 

So we are soon closing the V0. 

Want to try it?
1) Put some colors in the comment feed ⭐️🤙⭐️🔴✅
2) let us contact you to tell you more about the setup (chrome extension coming soon)

It takes a few minutes only already. I will be back soon on Youtube for the video tutorial.

Well...if we look at the Customer Price Index vs a 2% inflation rate 👇

Fed was doing a good job keeping inflation steady, but it seems like: 
- pandemic stimulus in 2020
- supply chain issues in 2021
- war in Ukraine in 2022
....and most likely other factors, are pushing the inflation way above the ""normal"". 2% rate.

The Consumer Price Index (CPI) is a measure of the average change over time in the prices paid by urban consumers for a market basket of consumer goods and services. 
Indexes are available for the U.S. and various geographic areas.

With so many data software applications and so much multidisciplinary data to analyze, it can be hard to share vital information across disciplines, in a fast and efficient way.

Many have found a solution combining a stack of:
→ Data visualization software
→ Python
→ Jupyter Notebook 
which makes it easier to organize data, share, document custom workflows, and even create full-fletched data products.

Global warming isn't the future. It's happening right now, and already has consequences.

Consequences for humans, where the people who will suffer will again be the same: the oldest, the most precarious, etc.

Consequences for our agriculture. Depending on the amplitude and duration, there are risks of agricultural losses (more info to come this week on that).

Consequences for animals. Livestock, which do not always have the best conditions to withstand very hot weather. Our domestic animals too.

Politicians who talk about punitive ecology are irresponsible.
Politicians who do not engage in structural transformations in 2022 to drastically lower our emissions and adapt ourselves are irresponsible.

I will communicate at each heatwave, each flood, each drought and will remind each time that without changing the economic system, we will suffer more and more climatic hazards, and personally, the 50°C in my city, it does not make me dream at all.

Heat maps are graphical representations of data that utilize color-coded systems.

The primary purpose is to better visualize the volume of locations/events within a dataset and assist in directing viewers towards areas that matter most.

They are one of the most useful and powerful data-analysis tools available in business intelligence; in my opinion.

GitHub use this to show how intense your activity is on the platform.

But the truth is, the needs evolve VERY fast. 
The more flexible and customizable, the more valuable this tool is within an organization.

The main difference between naas.ai and Google Colab is that naas.ai is a platform that allows users to train and deploy machine learning models, while Google Colab is a free cloud service that offers Jupyter Notebooks. 

Naas.ai also offers a number of features that are not available on Google Colab, such as model sharing and collaboration, model management, and model deployment.

👆
this is what Open AI answered me today.

I used the text generation API and extended it to 4k words 
This is the first shot. 

Not bad, but Naas is not only for machine learning models. 
→ we deploy anything that speedup adoption of future-proof data solutions around the world.

...And today day 33 of #66daysofdata, I had fun customizing Naas like a Google colab. 

Would you spot the differences?
Wrong answers only.

Try the waterfall chart.

A waterfall chart shows a running total as values are added or subtracted. 

It's useful for understanding how an initial value is affected by a series of positive and negative values. 

The columns are color coded so you can quickly tell positive from negative numbers.

I wanted to investigate this today and I found a cool library called pyvis to do it. 

A network graph is a chart that displays relationships between elements (nodes) using simple links. 

Network graphs allows us to visualize clusters and relationships between the nodes quickly. 
In the example below, the dataset used is relationships between the characters of Game of Thrones. Jon Snow is the most connected without surprise. 🐺😇

The network graph is built using 20 lines of codes.

20 days ago, we gave ourselves a month to create a data product that automates the aggregation and analysis of data from various social platforms and visualizes the results in a Notion dashboard.

The objective was to: 
- do it because we needed to follow our own content 
- build it in public to show how Naas can be used to create data products

Here are the steps we followed:
 
1. 📺 Define where the data will be consumed
Notion came out naturally, it's the go-to tool for a lot of businesses today.

2. 📊 Design the reports and charts
Thanks to our data/BI consulting experience and the templates in naas.ai awesome-notebooks repository, we got started super fast!
 
3. ⚡️ Create an V0 of an engine
The engine is how different templates can work together. We modularised templates and started assembling them, isolating the config and pipeline logic in specific notebooks.

4. ⭐️ Publish the project on GitHub
Once we got a first social media tool covered (LinkedIn) we started packaging the data product on GitHub. 
We are now duplicating the model on the other social platforms (Youtube, Twitter…)

AND, now it's the time to show YOU what we have. 

🗓 Next week during our community call, we are going to share in details how this product is working, so you can get inspired and maybe build one as well!

We will focus on the business side and the tech side of things. Because both are important to make an impact with your data product.

So, to all the notebooks lovers 💚 and notebooks haters 💚💚, feel free to join us for the first event ever on how build in public data product using notebooks 😇

I really hope to see you there, check out the link in the comment to register.

This was my day 29 of my #66daysofdata challenge and today, I created some documentation for the event. A big part of the data job is not in coding, it's communicating ⭐️

","If you are interested in data and business, you need to read this article about data products. 

Below is the summary, but I really suggest you read it all 👇

-------------------
Most companies struggle to capture the enormous potential of their data. 

Typically, they launch massive programs that try to meet the needs of every data end-user or have individual application-development teams set up customized data pipelines that can’t easily be repurposed. 

Firms instead need to figure out how to craft data strategies that deliver value in the near term and at the same time lay the foundations for future data use.

Successful companies do this by treating data like a commercial product. 

When a business develops a product, it tries to maximize sales by addressing the needs of as many kinds of customers as possible with it—often by creating a standard offering that can be tailored for different users. 

A data product works similarly. It delivers a high-quality, easy-to-use set of data that people across an organization can apply to various business challenges. It might, say, provide 360-degree views of customers, of employees, or of a channel.

Because they have many applications, data products can generate impressive returns. The customer data product at one large bank, for instance, has nearly 60 use cases, and those applications generate $60 million in incremental revenue and eliminate $40 million in losses annually.""

Jupyter Widgets are interactive browser controls for Jupyter notebooks. 

You can use them for: 
- Basic form controls like sliders, checkboxes, text inputs
- Container controls like tabs, accordions, horizontal and vertical layout boxes, grid layouts
- Advanced controls like maps, 2d and 3d visualizations, datagrids, and more

Notebooks really come alive when interactive widgets are used. 

Users can visualize and manipulate their data in intuitive and easy ways. 

Anyone can easily see how changing inputs to a model impact the results. 

One of the cool things is that others can play with it without seeing the code. 

→ Exploring, learning, and sharing becomes a fun immersive experience.

2 weeks ago, we gave ourselves a month to create a data product that automates the aggregation and analysis of data from various social platforms and visualizes the results in a Notion dashboard.

Quite a challenge, but things are now taking shape, as shown in the GIF below.

As usual, the hard part is to figure out how to understand, collect, clean, and format the data from various sources. 

The rest is about architecture design and orchestration. 

The good thing is that everything can be done with naas.ai. You have the power to transform notebooks into something much more powerful with the scheduler and other features, but you need to do it a certain way.

It is probably not what you think it is.

First, let's make it clear that there are 3 types of people working with machine learning/AI: 

1️⃣ ""The researchers"": inventing new kinds of algorithms. 
2️⃣ ""The creators"": applying machine learning algorithms to data pipelines, like chefs taking ingredients to make a nice dish.

""The creators"" job consists mostly in installing a whole bunch of machine learning packages and then tuning the best algorithms to fit a specific business problem.

""The creators"" are not going to magically figure out which algorithm is the right solution... 
They have to try lots of things. 
If the problem is easy and well defined, they can solve it quickly. 
If it isn't, they can weeks or months before any progress is made.

There is a lot of failing. 
There's a lot of iteration until they succeed.

And you know what? 
Often, they don't...
and it's often not because of their technical skills IMHO.  

It's because of their lack of connection with the 3rd type of people: 
3️⃣ ""The consumers"": the only judge and jury, only they can tell if the work done is useful or not, even if they don't understand the technicalities. 

Not every problem is going to be solvable by datasets, applied AI is about people, not algorithms.

That's why it's so hard. 

TLDR
Dealing with people is hard. AI is no exception.


That's it for today. Day 22 of my #66daysofdata.

Join us tomorrow at 5 PM CET for our community call.

This one will be different, as we will review and validate live the Pull Requests that are in the backlog 🔴

We have been pretty busy the past few days, we were not able to validate them async as we usually do, but it will actually be a good occasion to catch up and share our thinking around:

- Clarity of the problem solved by the template
- Ability to run the template easily
- Documentation quality
- Code quality
...

Most of the people working in data think notebooks are only made for experimentation and convey bad practices, but it's more a question of how you use them.

So if you are curious to learn more about that, just join the call (the link of the invite is in the comment) and let's talk about it.

If you are not familiar with Naas templates repository, we are building the most comprehensive catalog of data science templates to create data projects and products in no time. 😇🤙

Today, it's the ""fête de la musique"" = ""music festival"" here in France. 
Bars and restaurants are inviting artists to play outside, music is everywhere in the street.

This is probably the day of the year I like the most 🎉😁

So before going out, I took some time to explore how to extract data from my YouTube music account. 

This is what I did: 
→ opened naas.ai, started a notebook 
→ found a Python package called ytmusicapi
→ understood how to create a json file to store my cookie 
→ started exploring if I could get the content of one of my playlists

...and it worked pretty well 😇 (check the screenshot in below)

I always wanted to do a music data app to collect and label all the sounds I listen to without being locked in with a streaming platform, now it seems that I can do it with Naas 🎉🎉🎉

Let's see where I can go on this in future posts! 

This is it for today. 
It was day 20 of #66daysofdata challenge. 

PS: if you are a big music + data fan, let's connect and share ideas :)

Today we were meeting at Netflix to discuss user journey and template discovery with Christophe Jouin.

Over the past few weeks, it became clear  we need do the extra mile in terms of design with naas.ai if we want to really bridge the gap data creators and customers. 

Users interviews on our social media content agregator project, the first packaged Naas solution, makes it even more obvious.

There is a need to distribute the results of notebooks in a very efficient way to the target audience, with minimal frictions.

Most likely in another interface, made for distribution.

Our idea is to use Notion as a first distribution channel, but there is still a need to do the config in naas in a very seamless way… we don’t have all the answers yet but we are working on it. 

Stay tuned. 

+ on this day 19/ #66dayofdata, let’s remember there is much more than data in data jobs. 

🤙

You may be new or experienced data scientists, you cannot avoid to face frustration and loss of momentum in your projects. 

Today I read an article that propose the following steps to deal with hang-ups and setbacks.

I can totally relate. Do you?

👇

📝Take notes. 
When making plans and talking to stakeholders, take some time to jot down your thoughts. Ensure that expectations are clearly aligned. Writing things out helps to formalize and structure the process.

🎁List requirements and objectives. 
Get a grasp on what conditions need to be met and what constitutes a successful project. Be as specific as possible. Using SMART criteria is often helpful.

🙋‍♂️Define clear research questions. 
What insights should you obtain from the data? What capabilities should your new algorithm have? If you want to find the right answers, make sure you ask the right questions.

🌱Plan in advance. 
Break down the project into a logical sequence of comprehensive steps. What activities are needed for each step, how long should they take? What data and tools are needed to successfully complete the project? A clear pathway drastically increases chances of success.

🧘‍♀️Frequently reflect. 
The previous steps are not set in stone once you set off. Projects are dynamic, objectives and questions may change, newly arising obstacles should be resolved. Take the time to reflect during your data science project, and don’t be afraid to alter course


This is it for today. 
Reading, doing, learning everyday 🤙

Let’s not forget that!

Today, day 17 of #66dayofdata, 
I played with DALL·E mini model provided by Hugging Face 🤗 

You can enter any words as input, the model will generate 9 images as an output. 

I wanted to understand what kind of things you can get. I was quite suprised when I looked at all the results published by the community. 

It does not feel right to me when it involves faces IMHO (example below, only white faces)

When you read the disclaimer, it states very clearly the model may generate images that contain stereotypes against minority groups.

Nonetheless, I think this tool can be the beginning of a whole new era of creativity for content creators and artists 🌱🖼

Let’s see where it goes.

This post was inspired by a private conversation with 🎯 Mark Freeman II we got yesterday. We will collaborate on cool stuff in the coming weeks and open source templates on naas.ai 
Stay tuned ✌️

Have a nice Saturday!
PS. Kudos Hugging Face for providing such interesting models to the world openly.

A design system is a complete set of standards intended to manage design at scale using reusable components and patterns.

It takes the pressure off of design resources to focus on larger, more complex problems (like data collection, cleaning, modelling...you see the idea?)

So here is what we looked at for our social media graphs:  

🎨 Branding
A logo of the tool (i.e. LinkedIn), and took the primary color (blue) minus 25% of intensity to make it soft to the eyes.

💬 Title
A clear title expressing the metric and the timeframe.

∑ Total 
A total value of the metric we look at.

✅ This month 
A variation of the last values we look at in value and in %

→ As the elements above are on the top right, your eyes will likely go here first. In 3 seconds you have the key ideas. 

📊 Graph 
A bar graph to see how the data is distributed.

🏷 Data labels
The number of each bar on top assess the performance of previous period vs current one and the month in 3 letters format + Year.

Nothing more.
We are going to duplicate this for Youtube, Twitter, Instagram,...

Do you like this? Anything you think we should add?

","📊📉 How to choose between a bar graphs, and line graphs? 

When to mix both? 

Bar graphs show data with blocks of different lengths, whereas line graphs show a series of points connected by straight lines. 
This leads to a very different appearance, that's a given.

The biggest difference is that bar graphs are more versatile while line graphs are better for showing trends over time or another measure with a logical progression of values (such as distance from a given point). 

Bar graphs can also show frequency distributions (how often you observe different outcomes), or ranking.

In other words: 
📉 Use Line graphs to track changes over short and long periods of time, and compare changes for more than one group.
📊 Use Bar graphs to compare things between different groups or to track changes over time, best when the changes are larger.

What about bar line? 
Use them if you need to compare data on with 3 parameters. Line being the discrete data, bar tend to show the most important dataset you want to show.

Does that makes sense to you? Please share your thoughts below.

Today, we took time with Florent to think about the graphs we need to in the social media data aggregator we are building in public. That's a very important part of the process

🔴 If you don't do it, your project will 'very likely' fail. 

Why? 

Because people do not simply ADOPT whatever you are throwing at them. 
They need to feel you have listened to their problem, 
that you are committed to solve it.

If you follow my recent posts, last Saturday, I announced that we were going to start a challenge with naas.ai core team: 

⭐️ Build in public a data product that would aggregate the data we generate on social media platforms. 

Yesterday, we started brainstorming the idea with the team, and we contacted a few potential users.  

They told us about their story, the tools they currently use (ShieldApp, PerfectPost, TwitterHunter...) and we got some insights: what they like, or don't like,
want, or don't want.

So today, we were able to get started with some material and choose to focus on LinkedIn. 

👇 Below are the key metrics that we are going to work on. 

We are going to start with the most important one: the number of followers, create a chart in Plotly that will be embed inside Notion, and go down the list.

This will be our V0.1

👆 If you don't know this guy, you need to check him out, he is probably the most influential serial entrepreneur out there. 
The symbol of hustle, execution and digital advertising. 

So when he say 64+ content, it may sounds a little bit too much for us, normal human beings. 
But the idea does actually make sense.

Your work needs to be visible. 
If no body know what you are doing, your work does not exists. 

🔴 There is one problem though, if you want to execute this strategy You want to measure it. 

→ And, there is no tool that (to my knowledge) does that across the 5-10 platforms that matters.

So as we have build very cool data science templates on LinkedIn, Twitter, YouTube... we started brainstorming with the team about a ""data product"" that could do that.

It could be: 
- an app 
- a dashboard 
- a report
- an email digest 
- a database

We gave ourselves a 1 month to build something that anyone could use, something a bit more simple to setup than notebooks, but with naas.ai running in the background so users never feels locked in.

It's going to be a real challenge but it fits with our mission : make data science accessible to everyone.

So stay tune, and please share your feedback and ideas.

Arguably the ""if/else"" is one of the most used statements in Python. So it might win the ""most useful"" award 🏆

Do you agree?

For those not so familiar with Python, or want a refresher👇

It allows your code to execute a function if a certain condition is met. 
Unlike other languages, you don’t need to use curly braces.

The if-else statement is used to execute both the true part and the false part of a given condition. 

If the condition is true, the if block code is executed and if the condition is false, the else block code is executed.

Here is a very simple example to illustrate visually what it does. 
I really like how simple the syntax is.

If you think there are other statements that are most useful than this one, please share in the comment. 💬
I'm curious to see what ""else"" you have in mind 😇

That's it for today, hope you had a nice Sunday.☀️

Something big, that I think could be very valuable $$$ for all the content creators and companies in the world, especially Notion users.
I did not see any offer like this yet, but I got some requests 🤗

→ It's about automating the data backend of one of the most famous Notion template : the 🗓 Content calendar. 

--- ""If you are planning to be relevant in business over the long term, you need to consider putting out 64+ content a day"" said Gary Vaynerchuk. ----

Well, with naas.ai, we are going to build the engine to follow that strategy inside Notion!! 

✅ You will be able to track all content like posts, articles, podcasts, videos, etc. through stages of development, and automatically collect data and generate insights.📊

We were already using an alpha version with a small group of creators over the past few weeks on LinkedIn, but we are now extending it to Twitter, Youtube, Instagram, Facebook, TikTok...

We are committed to make it work like 🔥🔥🔥 
We gave ourselves 1 month (starting next monday) to build it in public and make it a profitable business line as soon as possible. 

Stay tune. I have the feelings it's going to be interesting. I'm excited to start as it has never been done before to my knowledge. 


Do you find this project interesting? 
Do you think you or your company could benefit from it? 


In the comment, to celebrate this Day 10 of #66daysofdata, I also played with the LinkedIn → Notion template already opensourced by Florent Ravenel 🤙

It's called Pyscript, I tried it today. 

To try PyScript, import the appropriate pyscript files to your HTML page with:

<𝐥𝐢𝐧𝐤 𝐫𝐞𝐥=""𝐬𝐭𝐲𝐥𝐞𝐬𝐡𝐞𝐞𝐭"" 𝐡𝐫𝐞𝐟=""𝐡𝐭𝐭𝐩𝐬://𝐩𝐲𝐬𝐜𝐫𝐢𝐩𝐭.𝐧𝐞𝐭/𝐚𝐥𝐩𝐡𝐚/𝐩𝐲𝐬𝐜𝐫𝐢𝐩𝐭.𝐜𝐬𝐬"" />
<𝐬𝐜𝐫𝐢𝐩𝐭 𝐝𝐞𝐟𝐞𝐫 𝐬𝐫𝐜=""𝐡𝐭𝐭𝐩𝐬://𝐩𝐲𝐬𝐜𝐫𝐢𝐩𝐭.𝐧𝐞𝐭/𝐚𝐥𝐩𝐡𝐚/𝐩𝐲𝐬𝐜𝐫𝐢𝐩𝐭.𝐣𝐬""></𝐬𝐜𝐫𝐢𝐩𝐭>

You can then use PyScript components in your HTML page. 

PyScript currently implements the following elements:

1️⃣ <𝐩𝐲-𝐬𝐜𝐫𝐢𝐩𝐭>: can be used to define python code executable within the web page. 
The element itself is not rendered to the page and is only used to add logic

2️⃣ <𝐩𝐲-𝐫𝐞𝐩𝐥>: creates a REPL (Read–eval–print loop) component that is rendered to the page as a code editor and allows users to write executable code. 
→ same experience as a Jupyter cell. 

Check out the example I used today: a simple hello world displaying the current date and time 

I created a shareable link accessible in the comment to open in the browser with naas asset feature.

Curious to learn your opinion about this (r)evolution. 💬🤙 ?

Today, it was the first time for me in Paris. 

I really liked it. 

The presentations were about Project Jupyter Book and Hugging Face ecosystem.🤗

I got to meet with people I knew only from their GitHub name or Twitter handle.😅

...and we had a nice time chatting at the bar after that🍺. 
It feels good be back at meeting people in person.
 

For those who don't know PyData. 👇
It is an international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. 

The atmosphere is very friendly and welcoming.

The idea is to promote best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. 

PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R.

And the conference are all around the world (see the image below). 
I hope to get involved a bit more in this ecosystem in the coming weeks.

There was a existing tools like:
- Jupyter nbviewer
- Binder
- Jovian

🔴 But all of these tools were based on the notebook itself, 
not on the assets created by the notebook.

So with this Naas low-code formulas, any asset like
✅ PNG (image)
✅ HTML page
✅ CSV
...anything, can be exposed to the web instantly.

You can either download the asset, or open in a tab of the browser by adding {""inline"": True} parameter.

There are many use cases you can build with this.

Today for the day 6 of this #66daysfdata, I did it with my personal website I created yesterday.
→ Check out the result with the link in the comment.

Do you have any other option to do that?

→ This is the most common use case. 

But you can really create any kind of files.

When Python first appeared in 1991, it was seen more as an “at your own risk” computing language.
In 2018, it became the language #1 on stackoverflow, beating Javascript.
Now, it's the language of reference in data science, machine learning, and software development.

→ Magic commands are shortcuts over the usual Python syntax designed to facilitate routine tasks.

There 2 kinds of commands:
- Line magic, denoted by a single % prefix to act on a single line 
- Cell magic, denoted by a double %% prefix to act on entire cell or multiple lines of input.

Today, let's look at the %run command. 
👇
Suppose you are working on a new project on Jupyter, and you wish to use a function that you wrote earlier. 
Rather than copying the entire code into a Jupyter cell, you can use the %run Python magic.

It makes: 
✅ your notebook more readable 
✅ your work more reproducible.

This is the technique that got us started with the naas_drivers python library. I will talk about it in later posts.

I think it’s a good thing if it influences us too. 
I like the practicality behind it.

Let's say you are a financial analysts. 

Your job is to analyse weekly sales by product, product category, stores and create reports to your management with key performance indicators (KPIs) 

But you have a problem. 
You have 2 different CSV exports to handle to get to your results.

→ File 1 has the list of products ID, product names and product category.

→ File 2 has the list of products ID, the value in sales, and the store in which it was sold.

If you use Excel you need to do a VLOOKUP, it can be quite manual. 
If you use SQL you need to do an INNER JOIN, it can be quite tricky if the 2 sources are not in the same database. 

🐍 If you are using Python, you can use Pandas library and create a consolidation table with a simple formula : 

df = pd.merge(df_1, df_2)

There is absolutely no problem and to repeat this operation over time and it is way faster in most cases than both options listed above. 

BONUS 👇
By doing this operation in Jupyter Notebook,  you can document the process in text and code, to reproduce and share.

But the best thing now, is doing it with naas.ai where you can schedule the import, process the file, and send yourself an email to build a completely automated workflow !! 

⭐️ Check out this Naas templates from Oludolapo Oketunji, she contributed to the open source project with a slightly different use case (students, grades) but you will surely understand the idea. 

This was day 2 of my ""#66daysofdata with #naas""

Hope the creator of this hashtag is OK with that, Ken Jee ;)

For the people who don't know the idea behind this, it's about sharing everyday learning in public about data science.

So today is: Day 1 ☝️
and I wanted to give a shout-out to the amazing Khuyen Tran that posted how to get a data frame from a website.

Even 🎯 Mark Freeman II was surprised to see this from the comments of her post. 🤙

I must say that when I saw this for the first time, I was shocked too. 
The syntax is very simple, and yet very powerful. No need to go for complex scraping. 

I used it for the first time to get access to financial CDS (credit default swap) on a french website....and we have a Naas template for that !!

Do you think it's true? 👇

I do.

This major challenge is supposed to be the purpose of data science: to make data useful. Right?

But the main reasons why it’s not happening are the following:

1️⃣ Data scientists are hard to find, and supply does not meet industry needs. Too much emphasis on algorithms, and not enough on understanding business problems (aka SME)

2️⃣ Infrastructure is expensive to set up and maintain, there are need for a dedicated team of engineers to manage the “modern data stack”.

3️⃣ Time to value is slow and complex, business needs change fast (almost on daily basis) but technical answer takes weeks to be delivered due to software engineering processes and practices.

This situation creates frictions or even makes impossible the adoption of data science in the organizations that need it the most to create competitive advantage and resiliency in very uncertain times.

We are trying our best to solve that with naas.ai with:

🖼 A customizable templates library developed by the growing Naas open source community.

☁️ A managed Notebook infrastructure: hosted on public cloud for security, scaling and cost efficiency.

⚙️ An easy way to setup automation: enabling fast and iterative collaboration between tech and business for instant results.

Naas open source, free to use with 100 free credits per month to run notebooks in production, so if you relate to this post, check us out 💚

Here is how we do it👇


→ In Notion, create a database, each page will become a report where you are going to include a chart. 

In the page properties, add fields that will serve as labels + indicators:
- Domain: Marketing, Sales, Operations...
- Period: YTD (Year to date), MTD (Month to date)...
- Scenario: Daily, Weekly, Monthly...
- Value: last know value 
- Var: variation between last known value and last period
- Var% : same than Var but in %
- Target: objective for the current metrics
+ a reference to the template located in Naas (see below). 

Make sure to put your database in gallery mode, group by domain, and on each card, make visible the cover inside page to show the chart and properties you want (Value, Var, Scenario in the example attached) 

→ In Naas, make sure you create one template for each metrics you want to follow, use Naas notion driver to connect to the database and start updating pages automatically. 

In the notebook template: 
- write the business logic as you see fit
- if it makes sense add a bit of ML to predict, cluster your data.
- create a chart and use Naas asset feature to expose it
- update notion database and add Naas template URL in a field
- add a Naas scheduler feature to refresh automatically

What's your favorite? 


📊 Matplotlib
matplotlib is the O.G. of Python data visualization libraries. Despite being over a decade old, it's still the most widely used library for plotting in the Python community. 

🌊 Seaborn
Seaborn harnesses the power of matplotlib to create beautiful charts in a few lines of code. With its styles and color palettes, Seaborn is more aesthetically pleasing and modern.

9️⃣ Plotnine
Plotnine is a python implementation of ggplot2, an R plotting system, and concepts from The Grammar of Graphics (the foundation book for producing impactful graphs 📕) 

🌻 Bokeh
Like ggplot, Bokeh is based on The Grammar of Graphics, but unlike ggplot, it's native to Python. Its strength lies in the ability to create interactive, web-ready plots, which can be easily output as JSON objects, HTML documents, or interactive web applications + streaming and real-time data.

📉 Plotly
You might know Plotly as an online platform for data visualization, but did you also know you can access its capabilities from a Python notebook? We have quite a few examples on naas.ai templates library 

→ This one is my favorite as they appeal more to business users IMHO 💚

🤙 Holoviz
HoloViz is built on top of Bokeh, Matplotlib, and Plotly's. It also enables you to create an incredible dashboard using the Panel framework. 

→ I want to explore this as I keep seeing Marc Skov Madsen, PhD, CFA amazing posts, but I have no time these days😅

So 👇
If you want to contribute to the naas.ai templates library on any of those Python libraries, you are welcome. 

- barchart
- linechart
- barlinechart
- horizontalbarchart
- waterfall
- map 
- heatmap 
....there are plenty of templates to do!

Check out what we have already done with Plotly and feel free to join our community. 
We are building a very useful open source data science templates library 💚

Now, there is a Naas template for that👇

🔴 If you are like me, you receive news every day in your mailbox.
But sometimes, they are not relevant at all!
You end up losing your time.

✅ What if instead of data being pushed to you, you would pull it from newsAPI. org and select the exact topics your want to follow?

→ This is exactly what this template does.

News API is a simple HTTP REST API for searching and retrieving live articles from all over the web.

It can help you answer questions like:
- What top stories is TechCrunch running right now?
- What new articles were published about the next iPhone today?
- Has my company or product been mentioned or reviewed by any blogs recently?

You can search for articles with any combination of the following criteria:
- Keyword or phrase
- Date published
- Source domain name
- Language

With Naas notification, scheduling feature, HTML drivers, this template is a good alternative to a simple GoogleNews alert that you cannot custom.

I use it to follow the news with the keywords: ""data, automation, AI""
It serves me every day.

I hope you will find it useful too.😇

With this Naas templates👇 You can do it in less than 1min.

Bar-Line charts are great because they enable you to show two metric values aggregated across a group dimension. 
They are useful for showing quantity alongside changes in trends over time. 

Today during naas.ai Community Call, we wanted to do a template contribution from A - Z, and this is the topic we worked on. 

🔴 Problem (Issue on GitHub)
As a business user, I want to see a graph with a 2 y-axis. This can show for example the evolution and variation of sales.
- one is a line with a trend
- one is a bar with variation 
I want to share it easily and iterate quickly.

✅ Solution (Pull Request)
A notebook divided into 3 parts: 
- Input: setup data frame with one column with DATE, VALUE, VAR 
- Model: create the chart from the python library
- Output: generate PNG and HTML files via URL link via Naas asset feature

You can now use and customize this template, plug different inputs into it...no need to go to Stack Overflow or the Plotly documentation...everything is ready to use.

Why? 

Because when it comes to data, Business needs change fast...
and Tech answers take time to be delivered. 

That's a fact. 
→ Good technical solutions for specific business problems do not just fall from trees. 🌴

The thesis for years has been to empower business people with ""no-code"" tech solutions.
But, the truth is that you are quickly limited by the design of those solutions. 

🤖 📣 Until we manage to just talk to your computer and get the exact answer we need like with Jarvis in Iron Man (and we can get there with NLP I believe), we need to figure out another way. 

It's been years that I am iterating on this,

→ the most actionable solution I found is to build meaningful low-code data science templates, that even people with non-tech knowledge can use, on very precise use cases.

This is why what we focus on at naas.ai, with the core team and a community of awesome data science template creators.

With Naas data science templates, you can:
- automate workflows 
- created graphs, reports, dashboards 
- include AI/ML where it's needed to upgrade human capabilities

Want to learn how to build and promote data science templates? 

Join us tomorrow for our Naas Community Call, 
and let's geek out 🤙

🗓 The idea is to create a template live and publish it to the Naas awesome-notebooks repository.

→ This is the power of open source community

...and the result of the hard work of an active core team (Florent, Maxime, Valentin) to organize this project and build the most useful data science template library out there!

These templates are made to kickstart #data projects and #automation in minutes.

Over the past few months, I connected with people working with many different kinds of databases. 

I learned a lot about why they use certain databases vs others.  

Here is the ranking I found in popularity order: 

Oracle
MySQL
Microsoft SQL Server
PostgreSQL
MongoDB
IBM Db2
Redis
Elasticsearch
Microsoft Access
SQLite
Cassandra
Splunk
MariaDB
Teradata
Hive
Solr
HBase
FileMaker
SAP HANA
Amazon DynamoDB
SAP Adaptive Server
Neo4j 
Couchbase
Memcached
Microsoft Azure SQL Database

Is your database on the list? 
What databases do you use? 
and what for?

Today, thanks to hope and optimism, the Time for the Planet movement (time-planet.com), which I am a part of, has just hit the 10 million euros mark thanks to more than 50,000 shareholders. 

When some people said: ""no one invests without financial return just for the planet"",
we were thousands to take the step. 

When some people said: ""no innovator will trust them"", 
800+ innovators submitted their projects. 

Time for the Planet has now deployed 3 major innovations, and you know the best part: they are open source!

It is time to act. 

The IPCC is clear: we have 3 years left to reverse the curve of global emissions.

Faced with the greatest challenge of humanity's history, we need all the strength we can have, and with Time for the Planet, everyone can contribute. 

🥊 Let's build a 100% community-based, collaborative, global greenhouse gas beating machine.

We are the last generation able to do it.

It's Time for the Planet, and we need you.

Data teams must:

→ work with those regular people every day,
→develop a feel for their problems and opportunities,
→ embrace their hopes and fears surrounding data,

Then only focus on equipping people with the tools they need to formulate and solve their own problems.

They should also ask two questions with each data project:
1) Who will this effect?
2) How can we get them involved as soon as possible? (disclaimer: ASAP)

☝️
This is, in a nutshell, what this brilliant article from Tom Redman, the ""Data doc"" is saying. (link in the comment)

And I could not agree more.
This is what we strive for at naas.ai, the business user is at the center of our Notebook templates approach because he is the final destination of the work. He is the juge and jury.

⭐️ Even if we help data literate folks, data engineers, scientist get things up and running faster, the goal is always to serve somebody else.

Let's never forget that. Data Jedi 🙏
May the open source force be with you 💚

→ Now, there is a Naas template for that!


Posting every day or even once a week is hard.
You need to put a lot of energy into it. ⚡️

When comes the moment to analyse, and try to understand what works and what does not, it's even harder. 🤡
You just don't have the time to put the results manually in a spreadsheet.

I've been there. I did it. I does not work in the long run...

🤙 This is why we created this LinkedIn → Notion template. In less than 5 minutes you can set it up and put your content analysis in auto-pilot 🤖

→ Post history
→ Post content
→ Likes and reactions
→ Comments
→ Views
→ Hashtags & Emojis
→ Engagement % (Likes+Comment / Views)

...all of this can be centralized a Notion database, and refreshed every day.
(Check the GIF to see how it looks 👇)

You can use it right know using this template: https://bit.ly/39RHbg8

+ You can follow Florent Ravenel, the contributor behind it created it 👍 Congrats to him.

As a data scientist or analyst, you just need to be conscious about this.
 
Identify when an audience is subject to confirmation-bias by asking MORE questions.

Yet crucial if you want to provide value.,"🚨 Managing a Product Roadmap is super HARD! Yet crucial if you want to provide value.

Here are 6 things I learned while building naas.ai.👇

1️⃣ Product Vision
This is critical as it sets the path to creating a meaningful product. 
This initial vision doesn’t have to be the final one but it starts the process.

→ Naas Product Vision is to turn Jupyter Notebooks into Services to apply data science in the daily jobs of anyone, using low-code templates.
That's what Naas stands for: ⚡️Data Science Notebooks as a Service.


2️⃣ Strategy
This is the case you build for your product. You want internal and external stakeholders to know the overall business goal of the project. 

→ Naas strategy is to create the most useful Data science templates library in the market. ""You have a data problem, there is a Naas template for that"" 🍏;)


3️⃣ Requirements
Understand what's vital for users. Know how your end-users feel about current products, what they are looking for, and if they need feature requests. 

→ We started by scheduling Notebooks using minimal lines of code. But then, saw the need to ""not start from scratch every time"" was bigger. This is why we are now building templates with the community.🌍


4️⃣ Product Plan
It is the way the plan is going to be executed as the project moves forward. Prioritize and set specific goals on this timeline, but let room for innovation and flexibility.

→ As Naas mission is to build templates on a variety of use cases, things can becoming overwhelming pretty quick. That's why we: 
- define priority domains (content, marketing, sales...) 
- score the template by impact (how many people can use it) 💚


5️⃣ Markers
These are important when it comes to keeping everyone in the loop about timing. While you might not have exact dates, knowing where the markers are to track progress is essential to keep moving forward. 

→ We have a ""✨ What's new?"" update on Notion accessible via our website but there is still room for improvement to make it more actionable.


6️⃣ Metrics
Make sure the metrics are clear and that everyone is measuring things in the same way. Everyone needs to be talking in the same language so there is no question around what is being measured.

→ Some metrics are pretty easy: number of templates available, by domain... But our ambition is to build a virtuous circle where we can mesure value created and reward contributors for that via our credit system. 💰WIP


To sum it up, if you build a product roadmap, focus on : 
- Product Vision 
- Strategy 
- Requirements
- Product Plan 
- Markers 
- Metrics

And this is a BIG problem.❌

How can any chef of decent restaurant assess the quality of his work without servers getting feedback from clients on the food he makes? 

99% of the time, the client is completely clueless on how the food has been made. 

Still, he can judge if the food: 
- filled his stomac
- tasted good  
- made him want to come back again, and talk about it

→ I really believe it's the same in data science. 

99% of the time, the end user will only care about your work if: 
- it answers a business problem 
- the output looks nice and clear
- the story is told in a way that it can be remembered and shared

In short, data science folks should embrace ""decision intelligence"": a discipline that augments data science with theory from social science, decision theory, and managerial science.

This allegory of the people building microwaves vs serving dishes has been coined by Cassie Kozyrkov (Chief Decision Scientist at Google) during her ""Making Friends with Machine Learning"" series. 

For me, it's a true masterpiece, and I could not agree more. 
I hope this post still aligns with the original author idea :)

If you are like me, you have reasons, purpose, energy...

But you often don’t know where to start. 

You make it too big in your mind. 

A confused mind does not do anything.

Clarity is power. 

So to keep clarity, you should do small little steps.


I always try to remind myself of this magic question:

→ What is the smallest action I can take where I cannot fail? but learn.

What do you think?
Any thoughts? tricks? advises?

If they don't manage to make an impact, it's because they did not:

1. Scoped the business problem properly 
2. Proposed a simple and fast solution to the problem
3. Iterated to improve the solution with their audience 

If you do not succeed to get the buy-in of your audience as a data scientist, ask yourself how you could optimize those 3 points.

Some ideas:

- ask more questions to your audience about the problem to be solve 
- make sure your understand them very clearly, feel their pain
- create trust, build a relationship: ""we are on the same side""
- communicate with them every time you are working 
- share your doubts, ask more questions if needed
- get things done quick and ask for feedback
- work on the quality of the output
- define the distribution mode
- create content with them

And the most important : don't ever give up.

We just integrated D-tale in Naas and it’s a game changer 🤙

Pandas dataframes are awesome but it's not possible to play with them, I was always frustrated I could not: 

❌ Display a lot of rows
❌ Filter items
❌ Do a pivot table in a few clicks.

But now, there is a Naas template for that...and it can do even more.

✅ View dataframes in a nice table that you can open in full screen.
✅ Apply custom filters and sorting on columns.
✅ Pivot your table from your cursor!

You can even generate Python code and charts from your data manipulation.

Storytime👇

Guido van Rossum created it in the late 1980s at Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI) in the Netherlands 🇳🇱.

It was capable of exception handling and interfacing with the Amoeba operating system. 

Its implementation began in December 1989.
(The month I came on this earth 🍼👶😅)

When he began implementing Python, Guido van Rossum was also reading the published scripts from “Monty Python's Flying Circus”, a BBC comedy series from the 1970s. 

Van Rossum thought he needed a name that was short, unique, and slightly mysterious, so he decided to call the language Python.

THAT WAS IT.
30+ years later,  Python is the most popular programming language available because it has simplified syntax gave emphasis on natural language. 

👉 I don't come from a tech background, I'm a creative, I love art, history, music, philosophy, so I think this direction toward natural language is why I love Python so much. 💚💚💚

But even if python codes can be easily written and executed much faster than other programming languages : you still need to write it. 

And I have to admit, I'm a bad Python writer. 

My thing is reading and finding the right way to make machines work for you with minimal number of characters. 

I find this magical.

👉 This is why I'm so pumped to work every single day on a project that aims at making beautiful Python Notebook templates to fix very specific problems. 

I'm grateful to work with an amazing naas.ai team and community. 

👍💬 I'm curious to learn more about you and what did make you fall in love  with Python in the comment. 

Have a nice weekend everyone !

Cheers.

We have iterated a lot, but I feel we are on the right track to building something truly meaningful for businesses and society.

Today's session was amazing. 

→ Contributors presented their Notebook templates 
→ We discussed the way we want to optimize the community production workflow 
→ We talked about the major improvement we need to work on to really unlock the last barriers to tools accessibility (something similar to what Zapier is doing but for notebooks)

Join our community call tomorrow at 5PM CET on Zoom.

We are going to talk about:

️⚡️ What’s new? 
- Dataframe just got better with the integration of D-tale, by Minura 
- Get your TikTok stats, by Alok
- Get Twitter stats, by Alok
- NBA betting lines, by JA Williams
- Track issues on Github Project, by Sanjeet
- Accept received invitations on LinkedIn, by Florent 
- Send LinkedIn Invitation from Notion, by Florent
and probably some data science art if Tony is ready to share his latest findings. 

🔥 What’s hot? 
Last community call, we showed our Templates Catalog on Notion. 
After a few #feedback, we realised it probably better to keep everything in GitHub (no context switching) and use Notion for scoping and reporting. 
You will learn the latest update on the Community Roadmap workflow.

💚 What’s next? 
Naas awesome-notebooks + Hackathons: we had a lot of messages (internal, external) on how Naas templates ideas is an amazing source of inspiration #Hackathons. 
We are also excited by this idea but we want to do it right. So I will present my findings after discussing with some of you. 


→ I hope you find this interesting and like the way we try to build the next phase of Naas in public.

If you do, you may know about ""no-code"" solutions like Zapier to do that.

A typical workflow can look like this: 
If → a new page/item is created in your Notion database. 
Then → record the same columns in your Google spreadsheet
Every 15min the workflow is triggered.

There are different issues with that : 

❌ You are locked in a closed source platform 😅
❌ You can end up paying a lot of money (0.05$/update)
❌ You don't have the ability to write custom rules in Python.

But now, there is a Naas template for that ! 

✅ Create a Notion integration and share it with your database
✅ Use Naas Google Sheets service account and share it with your spreadsheet 
✅ Define the unique columns on both tools.

And boom 💥
You have a fully customisable workflow between Notion and Google Sheets. 
+ if you want to run it a regular basis, you can use Naas scheduler (≈50% cheaper than Zapier/update)

👍 This template as been done by the amazing Pooja Srivastava, so why not follow her ?

What I liked the most about this very friendly conversation is the energy and passion she has for the field. 

I asked her only 3 simple questions: 

1) What's your story? 

2) What's your drive and mission?

3) What's your views of the future? 

...and in less than 40min we covered a lot.

We talked about:
- the beginning of Databricks 
- how she pro-actively worked with her clients to ensure success and adoption
- how she pushed internally for new features, based on users feedback
- why we are still at the very early stages of data science, and what is yet to come.
...and much more.

Thank you so much Vini for this very cool session!

→ You NEED to make your work visible. 
Traditional applications just don't ""do the job"" anymore. 

That's why it's so important to contribute to open source. 
How can you stand out otherwise?

Companies are looking for unique personalities. With both technical and communication skills. 
But like Eddie Jaoude always says, the trick is that 

COMMUNICATION → FIRST
CODE → SECOND.

✅ Good news = we make it our mission at naas.ai to empower awesome data science templates creators.

Templates can help any recruiter understand precisely the benefits of your work.

We scope the template (need), help you build it, give mentoring and we go out there promoting your work on social platform. 

Join the Naas club if you don't want to be alone in this game. 
The link to join the Slack is in the comment. 

Cheers :)

1) A copy of the notebook you are working on is sent to the production folder.
2) A “cron” task is registered in the Naas manager to know when to run it.

Then, the whole notebook will be executed.

As simple as that. 

Curious to try it out? 

Use a Naas template to send yourself a reminder by email everyday....to share what you are working on LinkedIn for example. (This is what I do) 😇

But if we do it, it's to create solutions that will go into production on DAY 1 and could be reusable by the entire data community. 

Most hackathons I've seen come with some problems (apart from not being reusable because it's about speed and not quality 🥲): 

1) There are not enough experts available to help the teams.

2) Sources and data are not easy to access. 

3) Venue and technical equipment are not the same for everyone. 

4) There are no clear conditions and deadlines.

5) Teams may lack of confidence.

❌ 🌎  There is tons of problems to be solved with data science, but only a few are clearly defined.

I believe naas.ai community can address those 3 problems by:

→ Promoting the work of amazing data science templates creators. 
→ Enabling anyone (even non-tech) to run these templates in secured cloud environment. 
→ Scoping key problems businesses and society face and address building data products from templates. 

Today, I would like to thank all the members of the open source community.

I'm truly grateful for your interest and motivation. 🙏

🚨 But that's not all 🍀
Today, we also welcome 2 incredible Advisors: 

- Alexis Monville, Chief of Staff to the CTO at Red Hat 
- Christophe Jouin, Director Ecosystem Engineering at Netflix

Their wisdom has already helped us a lot.
It's time to make it official.🚨

I'm beyond excited to see where this project will go. 
I hope you are too.

Repo stars is creating confidence and a good first impression of open source project or personal profiles.⭐️

Recently with naas.ai we used a site called ""star-history"" to create a graph with the stars history but:

❌ You cannot get the list of profiles who stared the repo.
❌ You cannot really modify the chart to your needs.

But now, there is a Naas template for that.

✅  Use your GitHub token to access 
✅  Put the link of the GitHub you want to follow
✅  Generate a table with all the ""stargazers"" and generate a Plotly chart.

We discussed why we created naas.ai and the design principles we followed to create the awesome-notebooks templates framework: 

# Title
Tags
Author 

#Input 
#Model 
#Output 

He was curious to learn how this framework + our low-code formulas (like scheduler) enable us to use Notebooks in production. 
→ Reducing the time to create a data products from days to minutes. ⚡️

This Thursday during Naas Community Call, I will show you how you can do that with an example.

I will chose a few templates created by Sanjeet Attili and Florent Ravenel, schedule them and create a dashboard in Notion with amazing graphs:

- Number of PyPi downloads 
- List of people staring your repository 
- Number of awesome-notebooks authored
....

It's going to be fun.

He is building an amazing series around data, Machine Learning and AI.

It always feels a bit strange when someone ask you questions during a 1:1 interview.
You need to structure your thoughts to be as clear as possible.
You don't have questions from the audience. 

It's also hard to have honest feedback, so if you have time to listen to this and share what you think. That would be awesome. ⚡️🙏 

You don't need to listen to everything !😝

Deepak did a very accurate breakdown the different topics we talked about using Youtube timestamp in the description. 
→ It makes it very easy to pick what you are the most interested in earring about 😇
 
Here are the list of the topics discussed:

- Why Notebook as a service?
- Advantages of using AI Notebooks in production
- Importance of low-code platforms in modern data science
- Importance of impact and explainability
- How can Naas make it easier to monitor the overall process deployment of an AI solution
- Naas Integration with different data sources
- Naas design concept of Features, drivers & templates
- Naas Scheduling capability
- Naas Asset Sharing features and its challenges
-Future of Naas

I hope you find this interesting. 

Have a nice Sunday! ☀️

A few months ago, my dad asked me where is my ""address book"".

You know, this little book people had back in the days,
where you have all your contacts ranked in by alphabetical order, written by hand.

First, I laughed at him and said:
""we don't have that anymore, we have everything online know""

Then, I realized that:

❌ It would take a lot of time to build it if I wanted to :)
❌ Most of my contacts are on LinkedIn, but the export is not so easy to get.
❌ I would not be able to see how my network is growing.

So, we created a naas.ai template for that!

✅ The setup takes less than 3 min
✅ The list of all direct contacts is exported in a CSV in seconds
✅ A chart is automatically created to show the contact number evolution.

Benefits: independence, observation and creativity! 


For a long time, we looked up at all the incredible data science entrepreneurs, ex- Google, Amazon, Netflix, Microsoft, Meta, Databricks, Airbnb, LinkedIn....

We were not feeling very legit launching our ""Notebook as a service"" platform. 
I guess we were under the ""imposter syndrome"".

Because we were not coming from the Valley, because we had fewer resources and less time to build it...we invented a new way to turn our Project Jupyter Notebooks into production data engines, using low-code formulas.

We did not re-invent the wheel, we tried to upgrade it to fix our problems.
We first used the product for ourselves, then open sourced it. 
And it raised some interest :)

Now we have the opportunity to meet and talk to those incredible people we were looking up to. 

👇
Being outsiders has given us compassion for others who are left out. 
This gives us a different perspective. 

This is why we now want to create the most inclusive community of data science templates creators 💚 and build the most amazing library of awesome data science templates. 

Starting tomorrow, we will start creating more content on the 250+ templates already available.

Charts are a big part of modern life. They are increasingly essential to our work, the media we consume, and the apps we use to track the way we exercise, eat, and sleep.

They are even more important in business. 💰
It’s important to choose the right type of chart for the right job. 
This might sound simple, but it’s not. 

Tools that help visualize complex data have become incredibly sophisticated (Microsoft Power BI, Tableau, Looker...)
But fantastic visualizations that are interactive, animated, and complex might not be right for your needs.

In my opinion, there are 2 types of charts that serve 2 different purposes:
- Allow viewers to explore data, 
- Communicate insights quickly and clearly. 

Both are effective, but only when they’re used with the right audiences for the right reasons.

→ This is NOT a trivial matter. A lack of ability to interpret charts makes people more susceptible to being misled = they will NOT trust the data.

So what should we do about that? 

I believe that AI + NLP can lead us to a new era of data communication.  

Where people that are not ""data literate"", but know how to read & speak, can interact in a much more human way with the data. 

It might be as simple as traffic lights and a little sentence to help them decide the actions they need to take:
 
🔴  → Red: ""something is wrong, move your a** and do more X"" 
🟠  → Orange: ""you are borderline, don't lower your efforts on Y""
🟢  → Green: ""you are doing great, keep pushing on Z""

...And it might not be on all the metrics, micro-decisions can be taken by the machines. 
Big tech companies are already there. But what about the rest?

I had a brilliant conversation with Somil Gupta about this topic when I presented him our roadmap for naas.ai earlier today. 

A new narrative needs to be created so that the masses understand what AI can do for them.

Does what you just read make sense to you??

Good post from Carly 🎰 T. 

At naas.ai, we are building open source data science templates using notebooks + low-code formulas so that even if you are not a data scientist, you can use data science. 

The idea is that you don't start from 0.

→ You can just run the template (with minimal tech knowledge) to make things work. 

→ But if you want to go deeper (and you should):
You have the code. 
You have the power. 

No blackbox on how things work. Customize it to your need.

Curious about what we do? Read below and join us tomorrow!
 

As I explained in my post on Monday, our unique focus is now to build the next phase of Naas with the community. 

= a catalog of data science templates to solve business problems.⚡️
= a platform to run templates and build data products in the cloud.☁️
= a place where our open source contributors can grow their personal brand and get hired 💰 

To do so, our core team is committed to: 
- create a incredibly efficient & collaborative data science template factory
- do more meetings with the community: 1 every 2 weeks for a start.
- do more free mentoring sessions to help creators get started and contribute to open source on a regular basis. 

This new phase starts tomorrow 5PM CET, with a community call on Zoom + live on LinkedIn.

In the comment you will find:
→ the Naas Community Calls planning to add to your calendar
→ the link to connect to Zoom.

Agenda: 
️⚡️ What’s new? 
Demo of new features in Naas platform and docs.

🔥 What’s hot? 
Review of templates ideas → I made a list or 300+ that want to share with you.

💚 What’s next? 
Full presentation of the contribution process using Naas + Github.

I know it's a bit short noticed, but I really hope to see you there. 

Come, ask questions, and spread the open source love ❤️

And here is why. 

Storytime:

naas.ai is entering a new phase. 

In March 2020, my associates and I at CashStory started the R&D on the Naas.ai platform: a secured and managed Jupyter Notebook infrastructure in Amazon Web Services (AWS) with added micro-services, to run Notebooks in production.

This quest was inspired by:
→ our need for fast data delivery and iteration,
→ the work of Netflix data team, betting heavily on Notebooks to solve their internal data challenges,
→ our feeling that most of the Python code in our scripts could be abstracted like an Excel formula, to make it reusable and ""low-code"".

With our little resources, we choose to build it in ""bootstrap"" mode while working on our consulting gigs with historical Corporate clients.

Last year, we launched and open-sourced the MVP, and it did not turn out so bad if we check our metrics:
🔂 6 low-code features
🏎 35 low-code drivers
💚 +50 contributors 
👨‍💻 +2000 free accounts 
🌎 +70 countries 
😎 +200 templates 
🚀 +300 people on Slack 
💰 +400 business leads identified...and a few paying already.
⭐️ +1200 stars on Github
⚡️ +3700 commits on Github
🤖 +10k jobs created 
🗓 +500k events managed 
and almost 💬 1m views on social media

But the truth is we were not able to focus enough because we were dealing with 2 business activities: 
- Consulting
- Product

And one was way more scalable than the other.

We understood from Naas first users and contributors that what is really missing in data science is ""collective intelligence repository"", an open-source catalog of Notebook templates:
- built by the community
- ready to use
- solving real business challenges.

The idea is simple: whether you are a tech or non-tech, if you have a data problem to solve, there should be a template for that. 🍏😉

Notebook templates can indeed be the building blocks of a true data science democratization. 

Templates can normalize the way humans make decisions (based on an agreed set of standards) and get assisted by AI, without losing on explainability or the ability to customize logic.

👇
This is why today, we are:
✅ officially saying goodbye to our previous activity: CashStory, while it will remain the company name, we will now operate only under Naas.ai
✅ launching the last product update of the Naas MVP phase: read the full update with the link in the first comment for full details.

If you relate to anything I've written above. 
Or if you just want to support this move. 

Please like or comment below for more power ⚡️⚡️💚💚

Cheers everybody. Have a nice week ahead.

PS: We're working hard to build Naas, and need more help! If you know anybody who would like to contribute to open source - in engineering, marketing roles, and more - please let us know and tell your friends!

There is a lot of interest in data today, but not so much in decisions.
The thing is all the data in the world has no use if they don't lead to action.

So don't worry about what your job is called, just make sure what you do is useful, and you will grow. 🏔

Because you will be fixing someone's problem.

Why would you want to manage stress?


You should manage things precious to you.  
Stress is not part of you. 

You get stressed because you do not know how to handle your mind.  
- Job 
- Studies 
- Get married 
- Not getting married 
- Having children 
- Not have children

Your inability to manage your own system brings stress. 

If life happens the way you want it, it should not be stressful.  
Of course there are plenty of external factors (like a war…) that can stress you, make you worried about the future. 

But the truth is, you should only be worried about what’s happening now. 

Enjoy every single minute you are living, and don’t worry too much. 

The only thing you can control, is yourself 🙏

1) A user works on a sandbox notebook connecting to sources
2) He adds to his sandbox notebook a Naas low-code formula to run it in production
3) Naas runner receives an HTTP request from the low-code formula with parameters, log the event or return an error to the sandbox notebook, and save the jobs.json file
4) Each time a Naas runner receives a new HTTP request, he saves a version of the notebook as history and considers the current version as the source notebook for execution.""

But here is the thing 👇


To understand the world, you need metrics.

And, there is no standard in the way metrics should be built.

Even worse, Project Jupyter Notebooks: the de-facto standard document to do data science, can get really messy.

This is why, exactly one year ago, we created a very simple framework.

Each time we build a Notebook, we make sure it follows the following structure:
- A clear title with ""Tool - Purpose of the Notebook"" 
- ""Input"" section listing all your variables (secret keys, filters...)
- ""Model"" section to store all the transformations applied to the data 
(if possible, create reusable functions)
- ""Output"" section that takes care of all way the content that can be created (csv, xls, chart in png...)

+ we use as much markdown as necessary to make sure anyone can understand what's going on.


⚡️We are now working toward a new version of this repository with our open source community.

→ This new version will focus on making it very simple to access private and public metrics.

...and hopefully, make data science much easier!


I will talk about it more in the coming days. I'm feeling really down these days with this war on Ukraine, so I hope this will bring me more energy 💚 🇺🇦

I hope you guys are going OK...?

Today, Russian stock market was closed. 
And so what?

Russia sanctions are a ‘big deal,’ experts say. But effects could take years.

And I'm here, feeling powerless.
I donated what I could today for Ukraine, but I'm really asking myself what else I should do. 

So, I made this quick chart with one template we build on naas.ai. Just showing you the magnitude of the freefall, while Ukrainian people are fighting for their lives.

We fight with the weapons we have.

These terms are often used interchangeably as if they all mean the same thing...they do not.


(1) A metric is a tool to measure something.

Examples:
- Monthly Active Users
- Churn Rate
- Net Promoter Score
- EBIT
- Cashflow
- Burn rate


(2) A KPI is a tool to keep track of how a key area of your business is performing. A KPI always contains a metric to measure the performance of that key area.

A KPI consists of the following elements:
- Metric
- Current value
- Target value
- Title


(3) Key Result always belongs to an Objective (OKR). It's a tool to positively impact the performance of a certain metric. A Key Result also makes use of a metric.

→ Very similar to KPI, except that a Key Result always has a target value that is different from the start value to measure success.

A Key Result consists of the following components:
- Metric
- Current value
- Start value
- Target value
- Title


🟢 Metric vs KPI vs OKR can be slightly confusing, since there is some overlap between them...it's ok if you did not know. 

I'm curious though. 

Question: How much time per week in total do you think is spent (average) on updating Metric, KPI, OKR in organizations? 

Is that : 
⏰ 1 hour
⏰ 10 hours 
⏰ Much more than 10 hours

Ready to read why?

A decade after The Economist warned us we’d all soon be drowning in data, the “modern data stack” is emerging as Silicon Valley’s proposed life raft.

= a new framework to move data around an organization and make it available for people to use and analyze. 

The framework has 3 key elements: 
- Ingestion: writes data from a wide variety of sources into a central warehouse
- Transformation: models that data in the warehouse, converting it from raw material to usable components.
- Visualization: provides direct access to data so that it can be visualized and analyzed, also known as BI (Business Intelligence)

It is inspiring conferences, articles, how-to guides, and companies themselves and a lot of new companies are looking to define their niche in this booming ecosystem.
The issue is, we don't need yet another data tool, we aren’t lacking foundational elements. 

→ Except one, the metrics layer.

People in the industry are so absorbed by the tech, that they are missing out on the very simple needs of decision-makers (ie data consumers)

To make those decisions, they need to know what’s happening. 
No fancy AI algorithm; just a simple narrator, telling people what’s going on. 

Am I in the 🔴 ? the 🟢? or the 🟠 on this indicator? 
Why? 
What should I do?

While it may seem ""easy"" to answer this question, it is not. This is where data science can help.

→ The core problem is that there’s no central repository for defining a metric.
💚 To bridge the gap we need to make them globally accessible to every other tool in the data stack. 

So that data science creators can do their best work at finding patterns. 
And data consumers do the same at transforming those patterns into actions. 

😇 I believe Project Jupyter Notebooks, when operated as metric logic engines can bridge this gap. 

Classic software engineering processes cannot keep up with the speed of the business, parameters are constantly added/removed to their decision-making process but Notebook can provide this level of agility.

At naas.ai, we are approaching this problem with Notebook templates, created by an awesome open source community, that wants to solve companies' and society's most challenging issues with data. 


Does this post make sense for you?

Automation, analytics, and AI, if they are well used and interconnected, can scale human work by 10x, easy. 

Not replace. Scale.

We are in the so-called  ""4th Industrial Revolution"", but I still see so many businesses stuck in the 3rd desperately trying to automate processes.

What want to do is optimize costs.
I believe they have to wrong approach.

This (r)evolution is changing how we live, work, and communicate. It's reshaping government, education, healthcare, and commerce —almost every aspect of life. 

→ It also changes the things we value and the way we value them.

Like Justin Welsh rightfully said in his post today, ""The great resignation is growing faster than ever"", and it's all over the globe. My take is that: 👇

🔴 Nobody wants to work a 9 to 5 where they repeat the tasks they have done yesterday. 

🟢 People don't want to work hard, they want to work smart. 
They are OK to scale their work with bots that can repeat what they previously did manually, to figure out what can be improved and act upon! 

They want to bring value not only to the companies, but to society. 

⚡️ Moral of the story:

Work for the future, not for yesterday.
Work differently.

Do you agree?

- product 
- finance 
- investment
you need to find patterns in your data to understand how things work (or don't work), which is the essence of data science.

But if you don't have the skills, or the team to do it for you, you stay in the dark.

When we started our R&D 2 years ago, we got inspired by the Netflix Data Platform based on Notebook infrastructure. 

But, now more big tech companies are explaining how they build their data platform and this knowledge sharing is amazing! 🤩 

Project Jupyter is always there, as a core component.

DARWIN platform covers: 
✅ Data exploration and transformation
✅ Data visualization and evaluation
✅ Productionizing

The users are:
🤓 Expert data scientists and AI engineers
🧐 Data analysts
😇 Product managers, and business analysts

This article also points out a very central aspect of what we are also working on: the Metric Layer.

Their ""Unified Metrics Platform"" serves as the single source of truth for all business metrics at Linkedin by providing a centralized metrics processing pipeline (as-a-service). 
And the way those metrics are served is through #templates. 

I think this article is A MUST read for all the Jupyter Notebooks lovers. (link in the comment) 


→ This article is somehow a good re-insurance for our little #opensource project 😇

If those companies are building on top of Project Jupyter, smaller companies with smaller (or no) engineering teams need to be served with something similar.

Low-code data science is the future.

It will empower more people to use automation, analytics & AI…

…the same way as Excel empowered people to do custom calculations and business logic.

And it will happen in a new kind of document : a Jupyter Notebook. 


If you believe in that vision. 

If you want to take part of this low-code movement around Jupyter Notebooks.

👉Join our Open Source Community on Slack.

We are building low-code formulas and templates for a lot of different use cases, and we are just getting started 😇⚡️

Finding the job that fits you, is even harder. 

If you want to succeed in your journey to become an accomplished data professional, you need to stay focused.

But how can you when there are so many ""labels"" a data professional can have? 
→ Data Scientist
→ Data Analyst
→ Data Engineer 
→ Data Architect
→ Data Storyteller
→ Machine Learning Scientist
→ Machine Learning Engineer

This can derail your focus. 

+ The time you’re spending learning specific languages, frameworks, tools is time you’re not spending working on real business use cases.

A lot of data professionals have ""context switching"" issues...and context switching is the death of deep work.

I have these issues as well :p

This is why I try to be careful about criticisms and suggestions that may throw me off the vision and brand purpose we're building with the naas.ai core team and open source community.

So before putting your time into something new, make sure your vision and brand purpose are clearly defined, communicated and aligned with your dream job.

⭐️ Mine is to ""democratize access to data, automation & AI""
...and I don't see a better place to be, than where I am right now to do it. 

What about you?
👉 How would you define your vision and ""brand"" purpose?

Web3 on LinkedIn, Web3 on Instagram, Web3 on Twitter...Web3 everywhere.
→ But what’s this Web3? 

(no the answer is not as simple as 'the evolution of Web2' 😇)

A bit of history:

1️⃣ Web1 (90s to mid-2000s) is a 1 dimension internet.
You can only READ information.

2️⃣ Web2 (mid-2000s to late 2010s) is a 2 dimensions internet. 
You can READ and WRITE information (post your own content so other people or users can read yours, and vice versa...)

3️⃣ Web3 (early 2020s and beyond) is an internet that is not only three-dimensional but potentially, multi-dimensional. Thus, Meta (aka Facebook) with its Metaverse.
You can READ, WRITE, and EXECUTE contracts.

It's like a decentralized stock exchange....for everything. 

⚡️ What do you think about it? Did you already invest in Web3 with crypto, NFT? 
Curious to learn more and exchange ideas. 

For those who want to take this subject further, I really recommend the book ""Token Economy"" by Shermin Voshgir on that topic. 

I hope you find this interesting 👇
Cheers.

Check out this very interesting article from Red Hat's CTO about Open source software and supply chain security.👇

😇 Open Source is everywhere, and is only going to grow. 
👿 So does the number bad actors coming with new threats...

The truth is that ""The software supply chain is fragile.""

→ Open source means everyone can see what you’re doing, they can also verify and validate your software and security protocols.

→ But how do you secure a supply chain for a product that has no physical form, no box to lock, and is created in an environment where anyone can contribute to it?

⚡️Chris Wright is giving here some insights on what Redhat is building for the community:  ""Thoth"" an AI to analyze and recommend software stacks for Python applications with an initial focus on data science use cases

I'm going to deep dive into this since it's a JupyterLab plugin (maybe soon in naas.ai)⚡️

To all my #datascientists friends, If you read until here, I have a question :

--- How do you approach security in your dev & production workflow?

→ Do you agree?  

If you don't know what a ""notebook"" is, the ""Jupyter Notebook"" (full name) is a web-based interactive computing platform. It combines live code, equations, narrative text, visualizations. 

Notebooks are at the core of every data platform today: Microsoft, Google, Amazon,  DataRobot, Databricks, Dataiku...
Yet, they are integrated into quite complex tools to make them ""production-ready"" = usable by the business.

⚡️ At naas.ai, we believe that democratization of Data Science will come from democratization of notebooks as universal data layer for individuals and companies, not only programmers.

We took a very ""grassroot"" approach to make notebooks accessible by creating low-code formulas (like Excel formulas) and templates that abstract complexity to focus on the value created.

It's pretty amazing to see how the idea of using Jupyter notebooks to create an Open Source “all-in-one data platform” has received a warm welcome. 

We're so grateful for this support. 🙏

As a company, our mission is to give the power of making data products to everyone, not just programmers. 
To give you the tool to build your own tools, here are the biggest ways we improved Naas in 2021:

1️⃣ Naas is easier to use.
Experience in the Naas manager has been improved and the Production folder became visible in your file system. This way, you can see where your notebooks and files are sent to be scheduled, exposed, triggered to create data products.

2️⃣ Naas is more transparent.
Track your credits in the Naas manager, and know exactly the cost of running data products in the cloud. If you are using the Freemium account, it comes with 100 credits, equivalent to 5$ of power to use every month.

3️⃣ Naas integrates with more of your tools.
Enjoy powerful low-code integrations with Naas drivers on: Google Sheet, Airtable, LinkedIn, Hubspot, Youtube, Qonto, Plotly charts...
And the most required of all Notion: it’s now very easy to get, and send data, content, and graphs. Naas will become your powerful data back-end for Notion in 2022.

4️⃣ Naas templates are easier to create, discover and use.
Contributing to Naas awesome-notebooks templates became very simple. And when you're not sure what to build, you can open browse and download templates from Naas manager by clicking on the “Open in Naas” button.


Of the 1 billion+ people who rely on computers to get their work done, very few are able to access data, automation & AI to create their own data products.

⚡️ They might need it to take actions on their social media platforms, develop business opportunities, monitor indicators, better plan and follow their expenses, cash, or automate daily operations.

Our dream is to be able to say ""mission accomplished"" when everyone on the planet has the power to do this. Until then, stay tuned for an exciting year of Naas updates in 2022.

More templates, more drivers, more features are on the way!!

Don’t forget to spread the #opensource love 💚!
All the best for this new year everybody ✌️

My thing is coaching individuals and businesses about how to work with data 😇 


People willing to connect to others on this network need to do their homework. 
Don't you think?

It's like the 10th time I receive connection requests from people in the Fitness industry saying we have a ""passion for fitness"" 
I always answer them that they completely missed it. 
...and they don't even bother to answer. 

They probably use some kind of automation tool to send batches of requests, but what's the point? 

I believe understanding the context of a profile is key when you want to interact on social media platforms, even more for sales purposes. 

👉 I also believe NLP and transformers can improve this. 

But we are not there yet. Are we? 
To all my friends in the data space, I would be curious to know how you would handle a problem like this. 

If you have some time, please develop in the comment ✌️


P.S. Yoga and meditation is my kind of fitness by the way 🧘💚

If you know someone that can help us for naas.ai let us know please 🙏

Last year I started posting videos on YouTube but I struggled to be consistent as it takes a lot of time. 

…I wanted those videos to be so clean and professional.  


This year I have 2 options, either:
✌️I just do it myself and don’t bother so much about the quality 
🤙I find a creative buddy that can support me 😅 


Below is the todo list I’ve been trying to follow:
- set the subject and tone
- write a script you can follow
- find the right time to shoot  
- shoot (multiple times) to get good rushs
- watch the rushs 
- make sense of what’s good to keep
- assemble the good stuff
- re-watch the whole thing 
- edit the final video with intro, outro, background music
- export the video 
- write a description. 
- create a thumbnail that is catch attention
- upload it in YouTube 
- check the automatic transcript 
- add time stamps
- edit transcript to be accurate 
- write a description for YouTube 
- edit and export a 30sec version if you want to post on LinkedIn 
- write a post for LinkedIn 

Do you find it too complex?
Am I missing things here?


If you are a student, freelance, hobbyists video content producer. Please reach out!!

If you are not, please like, comment so it can reach maximum person in your network.

👉 It can really help our opensource project be more visible 💚

PS: we plan to produce 1-5 videos per month.

And today, during our first meeting of the year at naas.ai, I finally listened to him. 

With the team, we started by reviewing all tasks we did not finished last year. 

(And there was quite a few 😎)

We dropped the tasks that were not relevant anymore.

And committed to finish the most important first, before setting ANY new goals and objectives.

👇I’m sharing some of them here:

- Upgrade our elastic cloud infrastructure with latest version of Kubernetes
- Finish migration of our documentation to Notion 
- Design and automate our new sales report from HubSpot in Notion
… 

What about you?

How do you guys deal with unfinished businesses?

I’m curious. 
Please comment or feel free to ask questions.

Do you agree? Here is why👇


You cannot just scratch the surface and expect results. 

You need to get your hands, face and body dirty. 

The deeper your go, the more value you get.  

If you are advanced enough, you work with machines automating heavy, repetitive and time consuming tasks. 

👉 You increase the amount of value generated by your business. 

If you are not advanced enough, you are stuck with manual work, you are subject to more failures…

👉 You don’t create any value for your business, in fact, you are destroying it and the humans that work for it.


✅ The businesses that embrace data, automation, and AI will always dominate those that don't.

🛎️Now more than ever.

It's about humans investing in machines to create more value and live happier & less stressful lives.

In fact, it can be the opposite 😅

I can sometimes feel I'm... disorganized. 
Every day, I need to do a lot at work: 
→ Daily team meetings 
→ Plan and organize the naas.ai product roadmap 
→ Talk with our open source community 
→ Do sales & marketing tasks
→ Have meetings with clients 
→ Manage finances and budget
... 

But since I'm a dad, I get more done each day with less time.

A week’s worth of tasks can all happen in a day. 
My brain gets fired up, even more than before.🔥

I think I'm better at getting my act together.
I guess that’s what babies do.👶

People who are already parents love to tell future parents that they’ll have no time. 
I think the opposite is true. 

We piss most time up against the wall. 
Parents get forced to become secret productivity gurus, they have time to read books, they just need to get things done!

(a conversation with Thom Ives, Ph.D. inspired this post 💚🙏)

There's an old adage that goes like “jack of all trades is a master of none”.

This basically means that he who tries his hand at multiple disciplines will end up being an expert in nothing at all.

However, people like Leonardo Da Vinci, Galileo and most recently Elon Musk dispels this myth as they have pursued in-depth learning across multiple areas to great success.

This is partly due to the talent and skill of these individuals but it's also down to something else known as “cross-learning” or “transfer learning”.

Basically when you enter into a new field and build knowledge in a new area your new competency inevitably leaks into existing areas of knowledge and can expand and alter your perspective.

This often leads to bringing concepts to a whole new light and coming up with new ideas you would have never thought of otherwise.

By reading a lot, exploring lots of different subject areas, building memory connections, pushing ourselves to the max and hanging out with other motivated and intelligent people, we can perhaps mimic some of the learning success of those great minds 😇.

Don't you think?

Add this low code formula in a cell, and you will see your notebook copied in the ""⚡️ → Production"" folder of your Jupyter Lab instance. 

Each time the notebook runs, it will debit a certain amount of credits (depending on the duration of the execution) on your 100 free credits a month.

This simple line of code allows Jupyter Notebook to be the foundation of creating data products. 

We started www.naas.ai with this single feature 2 years ago, inspired by the work of Netflix data team that leverages notebooks in production for key business purposes.

Since then we added more step by step.

90% of the job is done when things are discussed and written before coding in the Issues.

They will work on the same document to create scalable data products!


The story of coding has always been about writing fewer 0s and 1s. 
More power, less code. 

This is called abstraction.

GUI (graphical user interface) aka no-code tools provide a way to access power without even coding but are limited by the design of the interface.
→ You can build things quickly but you are limited by the interface.

Programming languages (HTML, CSS, JS, Python, R) provide access to a limitless world
→ You can build anything, but it's easy to fall into the rabbit hole 🎩🐰, where you actually end up building nothing. 


⚡️ This is where low-code comes in. 
Without the need of knowing how to code, you can use ""abstracted"" code to reduce complexity and increase efficiency.

Excel is a low-code tool, but limited in terms of explainability. 
→ How to provide trust on a number that has been built with multiple exports from different tools, manual entries, and unreadable formulas? 
I've been there...it's a real pain!

⚡️This is where the notebooks come in. 
With their sequential interactive computing cells, they can pair business rules written in natural language in ""markdown cells"" with low code automation and AI written in ""code cells""....and some pure code if needed.

It's like an Excel and a Word document, but with AMAZING superpowers.

naas.ai, PyCaret, Obsei....the number of projects that use low-code + notebooks at the core of their approach is very encouraging.

And you know what's best? 
→ Their #opensource nature 💚🌎

A revolution is on its way. 
Stay tuned ✌️


Big up to Lalit Pagaria, Moez Ali, Nikhil Gupta, and all the low-code teams working hard to abstract access to data, automation & AI.

They cannot escape it.

No need to try re-invent the wheel. Dropbox or Google drive just don't do the job.

Github is the de-facto standard to safely make changes to projects, and be able to track and roll back changes over time.

Yes, the experience of comparing notebooks is not so great. 
But if you are serious about getting to production, it's a requirement. 

Things to master: 
→ Cloning a repository
→ Creating a branch 
→ Changing branch
→ Creating an Issue (= problem)
→ Committing your changes 
→ Opening a Pull Request (= propose a solution)

and last but not least: 
→ Writing efficiently (description, comment, documentation) 

Because COMMUNICATION is always first. 
CODE second.

Do you agree?


P.S. I've been a bit reluctant to use Github when I first started to learn to code, but now, I don't know how to live without it. 😅 
Check out how we use it at naas.ai for open source contribution with this step-by-step video.

→ They come from 23 countries 
→ 40% have already contributed to opensource 
→ 91% of them are Jupyter Notebooks users
→ They are ready to push a total of 365 contributions in the next 3 months !! 

Reading all those applications, I feel so grateful. 
This is CRA-ZY.

I did not expect this... 😅
But it's very exciting !! 

For months, we have been trying to facilitate the way people can contribute to https://lnkd.in/gpx-8JY5 open source code base on Github. 

Now it's time to see if our framework can scale. 

We hope to build a strong community that will help each other to shape the future of notebooks ⚡️

At the end of the road, for the ones that want to sell their services on top of Naas, there is a ""Certification"" project that will make them build and share in public a live data product.

I'm super excited to meet everyone next Tuesday 5PM CET. 

Stay tuned!!

There is too much things going on, in my head, and in my life.

I wish I could share everything here…

…but I find it hard to document my journey and thoughts process.

I fear you would think I am crazy 😝 

I am a dreamer, a player, and I only learn by failing so it takes me some time to be able to reflect and write about it. 

Building in public has been my goal last year with naas.ai 

I did it.

But not as well as I wanted.

I have a lot of things to say and if it’s helping at least 1 person somewhere, I am happy. 

So with this post I want to commit to talk more about the topics I care about:

(1) Education and data literacy 
(2) Business and entrepreneurship 
(3) Data science and community building

Some of my content will be written in advance.

Some of my content will be totally spontaneous, like just sharing what I did today. 

I am committed to write and post daily.

👉 If you also have interests in these topics: a like and a comment (even if it’s your favorite emoji) would really help giving me some power! 

Now you can also use the bell in LinkedIn 🛎 to get notified.
It should be on my profile on desktop mode.

In less than 48h hours, we were able to create a fully functional V0 (aka Proof-of-Value) of a data product that automates text summarization from a list of Youtube channels.

On the client-facing side (#frontend) we have:  
- a notion page with the complete product documentation
- a notion database page that already has multiple display capacities (board, gallery, list) + a very powerful search. 

On the #backend side: 
- a couple of Naas notebooks working as modules and scheduled every day to populate Notion.

We would have NEVER been able to create a such valuable product for our client without a tool like Notion to iterate fast.
...AND some magic #lowcode formulas from Naas to abstract the complexity of playing with Notion API. 😅⚡️

Back when we started the Naas project, the concept of an ""all-in-one"" tool like Notion (all-in-one workspace) was not yet very developed and rather revolutionary. 

Now in retrospect, and after COVID, this tool is getting massive adoption. It's always like that with new technologies. The earlier you get started, the more you get ahead.

→ We hope to follow their path with our ""all-in-one data platform"" approach.

When we open-sourced Naas a year ago, we did not know anything about how to do it. 

We learned the hard way. 

We failed. 

Fast, and a lot of times. 

But we learned a lot. 

Our key learnings are that in data science, a lot of people need and want to:

(1) showcase their work to be visible on the market
(2) learn how to work on real-life projects or product
(3) get paid to fine-tune the opensource project to the need of clients

This completely reshaped our vision on what we needed to do for the community of naas.ai early contributors.   

So, today, I'm happy to announce that our program is ready and will be starting next week. 

+50 people have already applied (form in comment)

→ Objective: gamify the process of contribution and enable our most valuable contributors to make money thanks to Naas!

This will not happen overnight. But all the Naas core team is committed to that vision. 

If you are interested in our approach, apply for the first cohort of contributors that will be called the ""Pioneers"". 
Any kind of help is welcome. 

We are closing the gates tonight.

Here are 6 practical steps to do it 👇

Proof of Concept (POC) is also known as the pre-sales technical evaluation process. 

POV (Proof of Value) is used to identify the value of the product based on customers' use cases. 

It's not the same. 

To do a successful POV, you need to:

(1) Stick to the company's strategy
Your project needs to fit in the company's strategy and provide solutions to impact revenues or expenses. 

(2) Define clear objectives
Split “tech” objectives (what the product can do) and business-oriented ones.

(3) Bet on the winning combo “Operations + Management”
Work with operational business people so they can explain (sell) to the management team. Be there if you can.

(4) Know where to stop
Integrating business teams into a co-creation process is the most critical aspect because you may not know where to stop. Try to narrow your ""value perimeter"".

(5) Be agile, not fragile
Use a kanban board (Trello, Airtable, Notion..) to share progress and feedback to all parties. Materialize your commitment to the project.

(6) Scale in 3D!
Be sure your POV can expand on 3 dimensions: volume, geography, and business subjects.


...and the BONUS: document your work! 

If you want to do POV for a data project, the best idea in my opinion is to do it with notebooks, they enable both business and tech people to understand what's going on. 

We have done quite a lot of POV with naas.ai, but the best thing is that it can become an actual product without doing anything else with magic low code formulas to send notebooks in production. 

If you have a project in mind, please share it with us, we would be happy to help you set it up.

How many times did you laugh today? 

A few years back, I became part of the amazing LEAD program at Stanford University Graduate School of Business and attended the best course I ever had. 

The topic: humor in business. 

I just 💚 it.

It's easy to believe that if you take your life or your job seriously, being fun, playful, or joking around makes you less trustworthy in front of other people. 

But what I learned during that course is that successful leaders do serious things without taking themselves too seriously.

In fact, using humor can help anyone perform much better!

Here is the secret sauce to include more humor in business, following the researches from Stanford: 

(1) You need to know your humor style
→ Is that:  Standup 🎤? Sweetheart 😘? Sniper 🎯? Magnet 🧲?

(2) Speak your truth 
A lot of funny things are happening during your day. Just try to notice them and share them with people. 
→ Example: ""Today, without a peepee teepee, my son would have given me a second shower 😊""

(3) Start small 
You don't become the funniest (and respectable) person in the room overnight, start with moving from transactional to human with tiny funny gestures. 
→ Start with a BIG smile anytime you enter a conference call?

(4) Practice safe sets 
You can make fun of your mother, not one of your colleagues. Don't go too far.

(5) Realize humor is a choice
You are the only person responsible for your happiness! 


I would really like to thank Jennifer Aaker and Naomi Bagdonas for such an amazing course. 

Check out the very cool 5min video they made on the topic (link in the comment) 

I am 100% convinced that humor is an under-rated superpower in business.

Are you? 

Feel free to share stories and jokes in the comment. 

I will try to share here more funny stories about what I experience, feel free to join me in this very serious project 😊
Have a beautiful fun day at work.

I summarized below what it means, and why you should care.👇

There is an exponential growth in the quantity of data produced and linear growth of data insights. 
Basically, we produce more data and we make no use of it. 🗑

It is essential that organizations bend the new data towards new insights. 
But that cannot happen unless organizations expand the number of employees who daily work with data, at scale  ✅

The trick would be to hire more data scientists, but it's either impossible or out of the question.
(They are expensive, difficult to find, hire, and keep on staff.)

👇
To solve this challenge, tools are evolving. The idea is to do more with fewer resources: ""AutoML"", ""Augmented analytics"", ""Low-code"", ""No-code""...

This is where the CDS comes in. 

Gartner says they are people who create or generate models but whose primary job function is outside the field of statistics and analytics.  
In other words, citizen data scientists can perform analytical tasks that otherwise require more expertise. 

They can play a complementary role to ""Real"" data scientists and are able to push data models to production by using:
→ their business experience (subject matter expertise)
→ their awareness of business priorities. 

TADA! 

✋Here I am. Maybe here you are too❓

With the role of citizen data scientists, organizations are able to bridge the gap between business analytics users and advanced analytics data scientists are able to do.

👉 This sweet spot is where we position naas.ai in the data ecosystem. 

Although this role has not yet gained a lot of popularity, when you look at ""data specialist"" positions on job research, websites, it's clear that citizen data science is becoming one of the most critical roles in data teams.


I hope you learn something from this post.

...and I have 3 BIG announcements to make today 👇🚨

(1) Becoming a dad and working with an amazing team gives you superpowers. 💚 
I was able to enjoy my time off for the past 15 days and completely disconnect. 

(2) It's been exactly 1 year and 5 days since we have launched www.naas.ai on Product Hunt 🎂

(3) We have pushed a major update to the naas.ai manager. 🚀

This evolution is our humble contribution to solving one of the most critical pain points in any data project.

We have been working on it since we launched the Naas cloud version in Amazon Web Services (AWS) in January 2020. 

Taking time to experiment and learn from our first users has been our biggest asset.

Can you guess what it is?

= MEASURING VALUE.

To do that, you need to know what are the costs (human + machine) and the benefits. 

Benefits and human costs are quite easy to do, but when it comes to machines, it's almost impossible to follow costs at the micro/task level.

⚡️⚡️⚡️ We made it possible in Naas version 2, where you can now have complete visibility on:

→ JOBS: use of Naas features like scheduling, asset sharing, notifications...
→ EVENTS: execution of jobs
→ USAGE: in credits and in dollar value

Find attached an example for the free plan, where we offer the equivalent of 5$ of free credits per month!

✅ If you are already a Naas user, make sure you restart your server to update your Naas version and enjoy this new level of transparency.

🟠 If you are not already a Naas user, you can create your account for free with the link below ⚡️⚡️⚡️



I hope you find our approach useful.

LinkedIn is the biggest business social media site.

The audience is made up of professionals who engage on the platform on a business level and statistics show that 4/5 LinkedIn members have the influence to drive business decisions.

They account for nearly 800 million members in more than 200 countries and territories worldwide.

This is huge.

Unprecedented.

It can help you:

👉 find a job faster because most hiring managers and recruiters are already using it.
👉 share your knowledge and expertise thus, significantly increasing the chances of your discovery by various companies
👉 find business opportunities (they even rolled out this month a marketplace)

...the potential of this network is amazing.

👉 With the naas_drivers library, you can for example access your resume in the form of a data frame.

Here is how it goes:

1️⃣ Import the library
from naas_drivers import linkedin

2️⃣ Get your cookies
Make sure to use them wisely 🙏

3️⃣ Input your profile URL

4️⃣ Run the low code formula
df = linkedin.connect().profile.get_resume()

Over the past few months, we have built and open-sourced more than 20 templates to create insights from Linkedin.

Check out this template to quickly access S3 files! 👇

Amazon S3 for Amazon Simple Storage Service is a service by Amazon Web Services that provides object storage through a web service interface. 

Amazon S3 uses the same scalable storage infrastructure that Amazon uses to run its global e-commerce network! 
...no wonder why it's very powerful!

💪 It's built to store, protect and retrieve data from “buckets” at any time from anywhere on any device. 

Using Amazon S3 facilitates highly scalable, secured, and low-latency data storage from the cloud. 

💰 At naas.ai, we have seen use cases where S3 is used as an input to run a Sales prediction model that automatically sends an Email + attaches a detailed Excel file, every Monday at 9 AM to a Head of Sales.

(with the help of naas scheduler + asset + notification features😊)

The truth is, if you are not familiar with using S3, it can take time to set up, access files from a notebook, and share them securely.

✅ If you are looking for a shortcut, check out this very useful notebook 👇

This notebook uses the boto3 python library + generate a presigned URL so you can provide and grant temporary access to a specific S3 object.


I hope you find it useful.🙏🙏

Today, I rewatched a 12 min crystal clear video of Elon Musk breaking down climate change for students at The Sorbonne in Paris (France's Harvard). 

It was right before the historic COP21 climate change conference in which 192 nations signed the Paris Agreement in 2015 to reduce carbon emissions below 2°C, and preferably under 1.5°C.  

Since then : 

1️⃣ Over 1 000 big companies pledged major emissions reductions

2️⃣ Major cities are improving urban life while building climate resilience

3️⃣ Financial Institutions recognize that funding fossil fuels is a bad investment (yet the sector is still massively subsidies)

4️⃣ Technological advances make renewable energy more attainable

5️⃣ Expanding social movements reflect the public’s growing demand for climate action

6️⃣ Country-level action is starting to accelerate

YET one thing is still missing at the global level following Musk's thesis.
👇 

💰A global CARBON TAX. 

This is the takeaway of the Musk video:

""Whenever you have the opportunity to talk to your politicians, ask them to enact a carbon tax. 

We have to fix the unpriced externality. 

Talk to your friends about it and fight the propaganda from the carbon industry.""

🙏 I hope this topic will be on the table of COP26 in Glasgow.

Google Sheets is the most popular alternative to Excel because of its excellent collaboration abilities. 

Multiple people can be working on the same spreadsheet at the same time, without any lagging or confusion. 

But accessing Google Sheet when you want to play with data in Python (in Jupyter notebooks or other data platforms) can be painful, long, and tedious.

👉 With naas_drivers, get straight to the point and access or send data from Gsheets in 1 minute!

Here are the very simple steps: 

1️⃣ Import the library
import naas_drivers

2️⃣ Share your spreadsheet with the Naas service account: 
naas-share@naas-gsheets.iam.gserviceaccount.com

3️⃣ Access data
df = naas_drivers.gsheet.connect(spreadsheet_id).get(sheet_name)
df

4️⃣ Send data
df = naas_drivers.gsheet.connect(spreadsheet_id).send(sheet_name, data)

The problem I see with Google library in Python is that it does not come with those features embedded.

You need to configure Google admin console + code and it's time-consuming.

I hope you find the Naas low code approach useful.

 Good or bad thing?

Since we launched naas.ai we have identified that companies struggle to follow costs and ROI of data jobs (humans + machines)

This is preventing them from truly entering into a ""Data monetization"" phase.

The data stays in the hands of some happy few and never reaches a land of new opportunities. 

Naas is trying to fix this with:
⚡️business-ready templates to decrease the cost of development
⚡️a credit-based system to monitor the cost of running models in production

We have seen applications in : 
💰 Growth Marketing
💰 Sales
💰 Product development
💰 Financial controlling
💰 Cash management

...and it's a bit overwhelming because it can apply to a lot of situations.

I am almost halfway in my #66daysofdata (this is day 29) and I'm thinking of creating content on each of these business domains. 

👉 The idea would be to do one post a day explaining how each template can be used to generate value.💰

Would you find it interesting?

Today during the naas.ai Open Source Office Hours, we talked about it and started a real use case using Plotly. 

The idea is to create a ""one line of code"" production-ready chart library on top of Plotly to get consistent design.

Here is the takeaway: 

→ Create your first notebooks following the Naas framework (input/model/output)

→ Once your notebook work fine, think about how to abstract the complexity of the chart configuration 

→ Keep only what you need and start creating a function passing the parameters you want to keep

→ Once your function is ready, integrate it into the naas driver repository

→ Make sure it works by testing it locally

→ Push your naas driver to Github, wait for the CI to deploy it in Pypi, and then validate it works 🤙

⚡️You can now create charts in one line and focus on what matters: the adoption of your end-users! ⚡️

Less code, more business 😊

Yet this area is often overlooked. Why?

My opinion is that it's because it should come FIRST, not LAST in the process.

What we usually try to do: 
→ access data
→ understand it
→ process it
→ extract value from it
→ visualize it (charts)
→ communicate it (data storytelling)

But, one guy once said: ""You've got to start with the customer experience and work backward to the technology""
(Steve Jobs)

So if you transpose it to data, maybe we should ""do things differently""
→ communicate with the audience on what needs to be seen 
→ visualize it in charts

and then only
→ access data
→ understand it
→ process it
→ extract value from it to fill the charts.

⚡️ We are going to talk about it during naas.ai open source office hours tomorrow at 5PM Paris time.

The idea is to create low-code drivers on top of Plotly with Naas open source contributors to enable usage of pre-built charts with improved design...with limited technical configuration.

💚 We believe it will bring a seamless experience for the creator and for the audience.

Today, let’s talk about estimating the return on investment (ROI) in data science and machine learning projects.

This is day 26 of my #66daysofdata

In 2006, Netflix announced the Netflix Prize, a $1 million-worth data science tournament.

The winning team had to provide a machine learning model that would increase their movie-recommendation system accuracy by 10%. 

→ 3 years later, the prize was paid... But Netflix didn’t use the algorithm. 

🤨Why? 

They considered that the gains were too low compared to the effort.

👉 Estimating ROI in data science is HARD.

I believe these types of projects have a lot more uncertainty than traditional software engineering.

So many of them fail to deliver value or go over budget.
And that’s even worse with data science.

Maybe it's because data science projects are to be considered R&D: research and development.

It's usually easy to estimate the D (specification of what the system should do)
But this R is a real pain! 

Research means you have to explore and iterate.

If this part is validated, maybe deploying it to production is too expensive and the gains don’t justify it, just like the case with Netflix.

If it is not if you realize that the implementation isn’t feasible at all. We just can’t do it. END.

My 2 cents on this:
→ If you want to estimate the ROI of your data science project, you should do it after a data scientist does some research.

The rest is pretty basic. The formula for ROI is simple.

(Gains - Cost of investment) / Cost of investment

...But you need to calculate what goes into these two variables.

And this is the hardest part.

👇
Do you agree?

Coming from a finance background, I feel like it's something missing in the data science game today.

In this 25th post of #66daysofdata, I felt I had to write about it👇

If you don't know what Vitiligo is, here is the data I found:

→ Vitiligo is an autoimmune disorder and not merely a “cosmetic” problem.

→ Vitiligo affects the immune system which then affects the skin, resulting in white patches.

→ 70 million people across the world have vitiligo.

→ There are no boundaries of race, ethnicity, or gender.

→ Anyone - children and adults representing all ethnicities - can get vitiligo at any time.

→ 20-35% of patients are children.

→ Nearly 1% of the population is affected.

→ Vitiligo is NOT contagious.

→ Vitiligo is difficult to hide. 

→ This disease is misunderstood and the isolation people with vitiligo feel can be crippling.

→ Psychologically devastating, many patients feel isolated and devastated by its impact on their relationships and personal and professional lives.

→ There is no known cure.

→ There is very little research funding for vitiligo to better understand the disease and develop new treatments.

→ Many of the currently available treatments are not covered by insurance.

→ Various treatments, including topical creams and light therapy, can help some patients.

→ More treatments and research are needed.

☀️ When I started realizing this a few months ago, I sometimes used make-up when I was going on camera.

I did not know what it was, but I felt a bit stressed out about showing my face to the camera.

🙏 Now that I know what it is, and that a lot of people are suffering from this.

I feel like I don't have to hide it with anything, and keep pushing YouTube videos even more! 

💚 Because we must all live with our differences, and embrace them.

Today is day 24 of my #66daysofdata, and I rewatched some videos from Cassie Kozyrkov. 

I just love the simplicity of her explanations. She uses the analogy of the kitchen to explain how to ""cook"" impactful AI projects.

Here are my takeaway notes: 

🍕 Step 0-1: Ask the right questions 
→ Step business objectives, decide the required quality 

🍕Step 2-4: Get the right data
→ Source, manage, prepare the right ingredients

🍕Step 5-7: Use algorithms to make recipes from patterns in the data
→ Tinker the appliances, get creative, make recipe

🍕Step 8-9: Check that the recipes work on new data
→ Taste it! Iterate if result isn’t tasty enough

🍕Step 10: Build a production-ready system
→ Arrange kitchen so you can serve this recipe all day

🍕Step 11: Make sure that launching is a good idea
→ Ensure customers like it before adding to menu 

🍕Step 12: Keep your production system reliable over time
→ Keep your kitchen process reliable over time


I hope you find this useful!

If you have not seen her video series ""Making Friends with Machine Learning"", invest that time. It's totally worth it.

This is my #66daysofdata day 23. 

A bubble chart is a data visualization that displays multiple circles (bubbles) in a two-dimensional plot. 
It is a generalization of the scatter plot, replacing the dots with bubbles.

🟠 Bubble charts can be complicated to read because they are used to determine if 3 or more numerical values share some kind of pattern. 

→ The first 2 are a pair of numerical values (A, B) positioning the bubble in a coordinate system: horizontally according to the value of variable A and vertically according to variable B. 

→ The third numerical value (C) is represented by the area of the bubble. 

You can even incorporate more values (D: numerical or categorical) using different colors in different bubbles.

💬The story is narrated from the shape that these data points generate as well as from the differences in the relative sizes of the bubbles. 

Important as well → there must be appropriate legends represented by the colors.

👇
In this example, you can see 
A = Life Expectancy 
B = GDP per Capita
C = Population 
and the colors represent the continent. 

It seems very clear GDP is correlated with life expectancy, and that some actions need to be taken on the African continent in green.

⚡️You can play with this bubble chart by just running the Naas template that I pushed today (link in comment)⚡️

👇
Keep it simple and stupid (KISS) is a design principle saying that designs + systems should be as simple as possible. 

Wherever possible, complexity should be avoided. 

The idea is simple: simplicity guarantees the greatest levels of user adoption.

KISS is used in a variety of disciplines: interface design, product design, and software development, but I feel that in data science, it’s missing sometimes.

The term was first used in the US Navy to describe systems that can be repaired by a man in a combat situation with only some basic mechanic’s training and simple tools.

⚡️This is the kind of mindset we should all target while building data pipelines/engines. 

Make sure to keep it simple so that even a non-tech people can understand and fix it.

It’s about:
- documenting 
- packaging complex code into functions and libraries 
- writing errors messages that can be understood by anyone.

This is why we are building low code python formulas we call the « naas drivers » and implement them into naas.ai  notebooks templates. 

Yesterday, we started talking about it during our live session. 

I’m planning to deep dive about it in the coming post and hope you will find it interesting. 🙏

Do you know how it works? 👇

Candlestick charts are used by traders to determine possible price movement based on past patterns. 

The concept has been developed in the 18th century by Munehisa Homma, a Japanese rice trader.

Candlesticks are useful when trading as they show four price points (open, close, high, and low) throughout the period of time the trader specifies. 

→ The area between the open and the close is called the real body, 
→ Price excursions above and below the real body are shadows (also called wicks). 
→ Wicks illustrates the highest and lowest traded prices of an asset during the time interval represented. 
→ The price range is the distance between the top of the upper shadow and the bottom 

👍 The cool stuff with this version is the ""Rangeslider"" 
✅ It enables you to quickly deep dive on a certain timeframe to analyze the price range. 

In this example, you can see a 1-year timeframe of the Tesla Stock price and in 3 seconds, a deep dive into the last trading days.
You have both the trend + the details.

I hope you find this useful!

I spent around 1 hour creating the chart I wanted. Am I the only one struggling?

The idea was simple: create a Sales Performance heatmap like a lot of Top Executives like to have (😉 Alexis Monville)

It's a nice chart to be able to understand the sales matrix. 

→ You have business lines or units. 
→ You have products available in each units. 
→ You want to understand if you are above (green) or below (red) your sales target 
→ If you see squares in red, you want to take action. 

Simple right?

Not so fast 😉
First, you need to create a data frame that adapts to heatmap data model. 
Then, you need to take the Plotly heatmap example in the documentation and :
→ add a Title 
→ hide the legend 
→ understand how the color scales work (probably the most tricky part)
→ investigate how to put spaces between the squares
→ delete the default background to make it white. 
→ custom the tooltip

...it's not that easy. 
⚡️ But don't worry, I have just added my open source contribution (chart on the right) to naas.ai awesome-notebooks repository. 

Next time you want to do a heatmap → just start with the Naas templates (link in the comment)

🙏 Hope you find this valuable.

If you don't know Notion, it is one of the most popular and flexible tools right now. 

Notion is an all-in-one productivity solution and it's simply one of the best tools I've ever used.
It's is incredibly flexible. It can be a writing repository, task management software, a workout calendar, a database, and so much more.

They recently raised $275 million at a $10 billion valuation.

The key logic behind it is to organize content with Blocks of different nature 🧱
...it's in a way quite similar to a Jupyter notebook with cells in markdown or code. 

Our core team at naas.ai is currently working on crazy powerful low code formulas that will make those 2 tools VERY good friends 💚💚💚

Don't you think?👇

Today is day 17 of my #66daysofdata, I explored the Plotly library and tried to create a common design framework for my charts. 

The Plotly Python library is awesome. 
It's an interactive, open-source plotting library that supports over 40 unique chart types covering a wide range of statistical, financial, geographic, scientific use cases (even 3D Rodney 😉) 

The problem is that the examples in the documentation are not following some key design principles. 

In 99% of the cases, I want to change the look.

🔴 No white background by default 
🔴 No title by default 
🔴 No legend by default
🔴 No spacing by default 
...

⚡️That's where naas.ai awesome-notebooks can help!

Today I created charts that are homogenous in design : 
→ Vertical Barchart group
→ Vertical Barchart stack
→ Waterfall
→ Mapchart

They have all a white background, a title, no axis, a legend...
...I will add more chart types in the coming days.

I hope you find this useful!

Do you agree?👇

Today is day 16 of my #66daysofdata, and I wanted to come back to design and data visualization. 

Here are the 10 things I always try to follow. 

(1) One graph per business need
Your audience needs to understand the topic in 3 sec.

(2)  Choose the right chart for the right need. 
🙏 Don't use Pie charts for more than 3 values, it's easily replaceable by a horizontal bar chart. 

I always try to categorize by the kind of need
→ Evolution? line chart, vertical bar chart, timeline
→ Comparaison? horizontal bar chart, scorecard, leaderboard, bullet chart, heatmap
→ Breakdown? waterfall chart, stacked barchart
→ Mapping? mapchart or heatmap

(3) 3D is for video games not for charts.

(4) Prefer the white background.

(5) Leveraged the natural eye movement of left-to-right and top-to-bottom.

(6) Removed redundant elements such as grids or axes.

(7) Use light colors and scales, nice does not mean efficient.

(8) Play on the size, proximity, typography.

(9) Use contextual elements to drive focus.

(10) Use straight-to-the-point titles, subtitles, and descriptions.


The problem I see with dataviz library in Python is that they don't come with those features embedded. 

You need to code and it's time-consuming. 

I will soon release a complete set of charts in Plotly that follows those principles. 

Stay tuned 🤘 Share the open source love💚

If you missed our LinkedIn live event yesterday, we talked about it. 

Don't worry, here is the memo 👇


⚡️ Eddie Jaoude came to say Hi (he is one of the top Open Source contributors on GitHub, so thanks for your support 🙏) 

⚡️ Gagan Bhatia came to the stage and shared his contribution experience on Naas Hugging Face driver and other open source projects.

⚡️ The success of your journey (but also outside of open source) is simple: ""Communication First, Code Second""

⚡️You don't have to contribute only code
It can be documentation, answering questions...anything.

⚡️Issues = Problem
Start with the ""Good First Issue"" tag on any kind of repo, they are made for new contributors.

⚡️Pull Request = Solution
Even if it's not perfect just push something and communicate about it. Only the maintainer will decide when it's ready to merge to the master branch anyway. 

⚡️Find a subject that is interesting for you! 
If you don't know, come and talk to Open Source project maintainers so they can tell you how best you can help.

⚡️Understand the GitHub contribution workflow.  
A lot of people who are not familiar don't contribute because they are not familiar with Git. 

⚡️ Push a little bit every day. 
Yesterday, we started with Gagan Bhatia a contribution live that was mixing 2 templates: one to extract a transcript, the other to summarize text, and today I finished it + recorded the 🔴 Live contribution for you! 🌍

It's pretty basic, yet a good start for understanding how to use NLP.


📺 You can find the link in the comment.
I will also publish the replay of the Live from yesterday on Youtube this weekend, so please make sure you SUBSCRIBE TO OUR YOUTUBE CHANNEL and LINKEDIN PAGE naas.ai. It helps a lot 💚⚡️

Do you find this content valuable? 
Thanks a lot for your feedback. 

Cheers.

Yes...it's possible.😅

This is #66daysofdata day 11 and today I installed MitoSheet on naas.ai.

Mito makes it easy to do Python Data Analysis without writing code.

You can explore, transform and present your data without leaving Jupyter.

👍 I found the tool pretty interesting because it generates the code in the cell right below the UI framed into my notebook. 

👍 I also liked the way you can easily generate graphs 

☝️but the graph library is kind of limited to bar, histogram or scatter plot.

☝️ I also had to take over the code generated to do operations I could not do (adding a column to parse another column) 

It's still a very cool project to start with if you don't know much about Python. 



Thanks Philip Vollet and ∞ Ravit Jain ∞ for making me discover this tool a few weeks ago with your content.

I will try to use it in the coming days for different use cases ⚡️

Have you ever heard about the DIKW pyramid?

If not, you have to read this.


👉Understanding the big picture first will set the stage for your success in your data journey.

So what does this pyramid means?

The DIKW Pyramid represents the relationships between Data, Information, Knowledge, and Wisdom.

✨ Data is just a set of signals or symbols. Nothing more than noise.

✨ When you apply systems to organize data, it starts being useful and becomes Information.

✨ Knowledge allows us to detect patterns in the Information. It’s the foundation that will let us build predictive models and generate real insights.

✨ Wisdom is all about the future: it relies on Knowledge but it can help to shape your “gut feeling” and intuition, giving you an exponential competitive advantage.

The Hierarchy, much like Maslow’s Hierarchy, illustrates that there is a large and necessary “foundation” to the pyramid.

🙏 We must aspire to move to the top of the pyramid to reach Wisdom.

Keeping this framework in mind has helped me organize my thoughts and deliver data projects for the past 5 years.

What you need to do, is not go blindly into the data.

Visualize what wisdom will be like.
= What will make your project a success in the eyes of everyone?

If you find this interesting, please like and comment 😉👍 💬

BONUS 👇
The origin of this mental framework is coming from a poet: T.S.Eliot.

In 1934 Eliot wrote:
""""
Where is the Life we have lost in living?
Where is the wisdom we have lost in Knowledge?
Where is the knowledge we have lost in Information?
""""

Yes! It's not even coming from a data scientist 😅

Today I re-watched the video of Cassie Kozyrkov on this topic and used 2 naas.ai templates to: 

→ Extract the transcript from the YouTube video
→ Run Hugging Face naas driver and perform NLP text summarization task on the transcript, using T5-small model.

The results are pretty cool. 
This is what came out.👇

""""""

The research machine learning and applied side the decision intelligence side are as different from one another as building microwave ovens and innovating in recipes in the kitchen at scale.

It's almost like no one thought about the era where we would have warehouses upon warehouses of microwaves waiting ready to go.

The entire strategy here is hope. You hope that someone will spend their whole lives learning every little detail about how to make a better microwave and at some point we'll transcend and become a great chef.

""""""

Indeed, Cassie is using this ""chef allegory"" to explain why businesses fail at machine learning. 

💬 If I would have summarized it myself, I would have said that it's because companies emphasis too much on hiring top-notch researchers (that understand the deep complexity of the ML algorithms) and not enough on hiring people that can use the ML algorithm to fix business problems.

This insight from Cassie, Chief Decision Scientist at Google, is HUGE. 

⚡️It's time to use ML to fix business problems, we have enough ML algorithms ready to use and easy to integrate into notebooks, to deliver value for businesses. 

→ I will push the notebook I built on Github soon.

…but it took me literally 3min to build it, so I also challenge you to build it yourself 😉 (links in comment)

#66daysofdata Day 7

Before switching to data, I worked in Finance and did a lot of Excel. 
...I spent HOURS of my life copy-pasting tables under each other...and I know there is still plenty of people doing it. 

Excel is still, to date, the best friend of my fellow finance people for consolidation. 

But it's NOT necessarily the best tool for financial consolidation. 

🐍 Instead, you should use a simple ""For"" Loop in Python. 

A ""For"" Loop is used to repeat a specific block of code a known number of times, also called an iteration.

Here is how it goes: 

## Input 
→ Import the necessary libraries: os and pandas 

## Model 
Use a for loop to 
→ List all the files in the current directory with os.listdir().
→ Filter files with the .endswith(‘.xlsx’) method.
→ Make sure the files will be stored into a list called my_list and then combined with pd.concat()
Then
→ Return a dataframe and name it df_concat. 

## Output
→ Export your dataframe to an Excel file.

💚 The beauty of this is that you can reuse it for everything.


I just pushed a Notebook template on naas.ai GitHub repository on this topic.
👉 Click the link below, then on the ""Open in Naas"" button, and try it out LIVE. 



P.S. Please tag your friends or colleagues that work in Finance and consolidate data in Excel, this might same them HOURS of work. 

P.S.S.  Your support with 👍💚 + 💬 gives me the power to keep going with this challenge ⚡️⚡️⚡️

If you are interested in the AI field, you must join Scale TransformX
A two-day, FREE virtual conference bringing together a crazy panel of leaders in the field. 

The topic is very dear to us at naas.ai: ""Shift from research to reality within AI and Machine Learning"".

= Going to production ⚡️⚡️⚡️

During the opening conference by Ilya Sutskever (Co-Founder and Chief Scientist at OpenAI), a few things raised my attention. 👀

""GPT3 has a real big level of understanding, but it’s really not human like""

""The real challenge is alignment : how to make sure GPT3 will faithfully fulfill your intend""

""GPT3 is a useful system, not profoundly smart, but already interesting.""

He was very humble about it. But it like this vibe 👍

→ Today GPT3 is good at a lot of taks, still you need to know how to ask. 

If you don't ask the right question, you will not get the right answer. 

It's about the ""metalanguage"" and ""prompt engineering"" Denis Rothman is talking about in his recent posts. 

+ of course DATA! 

Next conference I will not miss is the one from Andrew Ng about data-centric AI. 


And you? What conference will you attend? 💬

Unfortunately, it's often not the case.


Github is one of the most well-known and widely used platforms for ""version control"".

Version control, also known as source control, is the practice of tracking and managing changes on code.

Files, where the code is written, are stored in a central remote location known as a repository. It's basically a folder. 

🪄 But the magic is that each time you make a change on this folder and push it to Github, a new version of this folder will be stored and recorded forever. It's called a commit. 

It means that you can roll back whenever you want.

❓ But what if you are working as a team?

👉 For that, you need to understand the concept of branching, a temporary copy of the master folder, where you can make changes there first without fear of breaking anything.

But that's not all! 

The real magic happens when everyone masters this workflow:

(1) An Issue is raised on the repository → Issue = The Problem

(2) This Issue is linked to a Project Roadmap → Github provides a Kanban board to do that: Github Project

(3) A member of the team is assigned to this issue and starts working on it on a branch.

(4) When the Issue has been completed → a commit to the branch and a Pull Request can be sent for review = The Solution 

(5) If the review is successful, the reviewer can merge the Pull Request to the ""master"" branch 

(6) Bonus: a CI (continuous integration) makes some additional controls to make sure nothing will break. 

I believe this workflow can DRAMATICALLY improve data teams' efficiency and productivity. 


💬 What do you think? Did I miss something?


We are using it for the naas.ai project, our contributors use it, it's very efficient and I really encourage everyone to try it for their project. 

📺 Check out this step-by-step tutorial about it.

Yes? No? Let’s debate.


Before I learned how to code I used this program called Excel. 

You may have already heard about it. 😅

What you don’t realize, is that when you are writing formulas in Excel, you are actually already coding...

…“low coding” to be more accurate.

You are not really coding, but you are using a certain level of abstraction (the formulas) to write language that your machine will understand. 

🔴 When I started working in Treasury, I had to produce tons of reports every month in Excel.

I quickly realized that analyzing data via this point-and-click interface and low code formulas was not so efficient. 

🐁 It really requires manual time in which I have to physically use the mouse to click the program, import the data, set up the spreadsheet, arrange formulas together + wait minutes (or hours) for my computer to deliver the output. 

→ It was quite tedious but most of all not reproducible nor auditable. 

VS 

✅ When I learned how to code in Python and Jupyter notebooks, I realized that I could do a lot more, in less time. 

Coding gives you the power to create and automate anything you want…without using your mouse 🪤

→ And everybody can run this code, and reproduce your work.


I’m still a big fan of Excel but YES I would recommend everybody to learn how to code.

It might be overwhelming at first but you can start small. 

Learn about the basics: HTML, CSS, JS, then Python or R for data science. 
It feels liberating. 

👉 Check out this Notebook template I made to create an end-to-end website in 5min.

Just open the link in the first comment, click on the “Open in Naas” button, and play the cells of the notebook
👇

Input part : 
→ Download the HTML file behind example .com website in Python 

Modeling part: 
→ Click right to open + edit the file downloaded 
→ Display the Stanford HTML cheat sheet to learn about HTML
→ Manually change the text to make it your own
→ Use Google search to go further in the customization (I recommend using Stackoverflow + W3Schools)

Output part: 
→ Use Naas asset formula to generate a shareable URL. 


🪄 Et voila, you have a website running for free. 


You can also check out the video replay of our Open Source Office Hours (it starts at min 23:54) where I explain how simple it is in more detail 🤪

Jupyter notebook is basically a document where you can write text and run code within a web browser. 

It’s an indirect acronym of three languages — Julia, Python, and R.

It has originally been build to documenting research and scientific papers.

But now it’s powering a lot of teams and business applications. 

✍️ The text is written in Markdown.
⚙️ The code can be written in different languages (40+ programming languages supported)

What Makes Jupyter Notebook the ""De Facto Choice"" is without a doubt its #opensource and interactive computing nature. 💚

→ Project Jupyter is maintained by an amazing team of contributors from different industries and has become the universal layer to do data science.

A lot of Jupyter notebook based services are now flourishing in the market:
- Deepnote focuses on data teams and collaboration 
- Google Colab provides free GPU and sync with your google drive
...
...the list of Jupyter powered solutions is very long! 🤪

naas.ai is one of them and contrary to others, we want to keep intact the original project and stay open source. 

🪄 We simply added some magic features around it to enable anyone to build end-to-end products. 

Coming from Excel, I was sometimes not able to explain to my boss how I got the result I was presenting to him. Too many data sources, copy/paste of cells, manual plugs… 

With Jupyter Notebooks, those frictions are over. 

It is the best way of crafting a story with data and bring full transparency on how it has been written.


Do you agree?


P.S. This post is part of my #66daysofday, this is day 2! Today finished the Youtube playlist of Data Professor, created my plan for the challenge, and I wanted to come back on this essential tool in the data science arsenal.

What does this hashtag even mean?

""66 days of data"" is an initiative that Ken Jee started in 2020.

The big idea is that for 66 days you spend at least 5 minutes each day learning about data science.

🎯 The objective of this challenge is to share what you learned each day to create a habit of learning and sharing your work.  

You can do it on your platform of choice: 
Linkedin, Twitter, Facebook, or on the discord community that's been created that has 6k+ members!!!

✅ There are 2 main benefits : 

(1) You are creating a habit around learning every day 
→ Data is this field where you are never going to be done learning, so it's quite an important aspect. 

(2) It is creating accountability
→ Putting your work out gives your a little extra social pressure to keep you going. 


💚 What I liked about this 66 days challenge is the community aspect. 

But I didn't feel legitimate to do it until I listened to Ken Jee's video saying that ""Project-based"" learning was for him the most effective way of learning.  

And could not agree more. This is how I roll 😉


💡So why not using this challenge to re-learn everything I know about data?

In short, I don't come from a technical background, I started working in Finance, was frustrated spending hours in Excel and VBA, and told myself how to code. 

Jupyter Notebooks and Python saved my life 🙏

I became an entrepreneur and ended up building an all-in-one data platform based on notebooks → www.naas.ai 

With my team and a group of awesome contributors, we have open sourced more than +100 notebooks templates over the past 11 months


👉 I have the feeling that this challenge is the best way to put my head into it again, re-learn how they work, and share this with you. 

Follow me Jérémy Ravenel if you want to stay updated. 

It's going to be about : 
#jupyternotebook 
#businessapplications  
#datamining #dataanalytics #datascience 
#automation
#ai
#lowcodeplatform

and I really hope you will benefit from the content I will share.

Here is the takeaway 🔵👇🔴


(1) Code is a highly sensitive decision-making process, it is power!

(2) Coder: someone who writes language for computers (aka machines)

(3) The first person to recognize that the machine had applications beyond pure calculation is a woman: Ada Byron

(4) The power of code amplifies the ability of people to do what they choose to do 🧐

(5) The history of code has been all about writing less than 1's and 0's: more power with less effort 🙃

(6) It's not complicated to get started with coding, build your own website (I did it in 5min with naas.ai) and learn how to ask questions to Google.

(7) 🌎 GUIs have enabled millions of people to use computers.

(8) ""Transformer models, the next generation of AI, is totally changing the game because of their emerging nature: it can perform tasks it was not initially designed to do"".  🙏 Denis Rothman

→ They are getting implemented in every big tech company and we don't even see it (ex: Google search powered by Google BERT)

(9) Even if GPT3 is private, it's possible to train a Transformer model with decent hardware...and it's encouraging: ""AI can be democratized"" (anyone could train his own Transformer) 🙏 Thom Ives, Ph.D.

(10) Most of the coders are white and asian males programming today, leading to bias in AI → We need more diversity! 💚🌎

Come with me down the rabbit hole. 🔵🔴
👇

We are 7.9 billion people in the world today. 
= 100%

4.7 billion are active internet users. 
= 59%

39 million know how to code. 
= 0.5%

👇
We are not in Matrix. 
Yet so many people are spending endless hours in a world they don't know anything about: the WEB.

This virtual world is designed to function as a rabbit hole because of the way hyperlinks work.

🌊 With this in mind, surfing the web is then a voluntary trip down the rabbit hole. 


🔑 The key is not to fight against technologies, but in making people more conscious about how they function.


🚨 Let's unpack this during our 1st 📺 [LIVE] Open Source Office Hours. 

Topics: 
(1) How do the web and the ""cloud"" works? 
(2) How to make a website in 5 min? (using naas.ai)
(3) How the next generation of AI (aka Transformers) is integrated into real-world applications? 

If you are not a coder → join the session to ""wake up"" 😎
If you are a coder → join to share your story and explain how you became one.  


VERY Special guests are going to join the conversation. 
Don't miss out.

Check out our Free LinkedIn Data Content Creators database to figure it out.


Last week, I shared 10 profiles to follow, but I realized that there are more than 80+ people creating content regularly on these subjects. 

Besides helping you stay informed on the current market trends, the content you read is here to inspire, educate, entertain or debate on problems you might face at work.

🤪 I guess it makes you feel less alone. 
At least, this is what it is doing to me.

If it does not, maybe you are missing out on some amazing content.

This is why with Maxime (naas.ai CTO) we choose to apply our data skills to this topic. 

We created the first free “LinkedIn Data Content Creators database”, where you will be able to access a curated list of amazing people working in the data space. 🚀

Want to know how we did? 




...No surprise: we used www.naas.ai 

Here is how we designed our notebook:
👇

Input :
→ Get a handpicked list of content creators (name, profile URL) in Notion

Model :
→ Use LinkedIn Naas drivers to pull data (profile, posts).
→ Use DuckDB to store the data in parquet files by content creators with their profile and posts data.
→ Make aggregations and count the number of posts, likes, comments.
→ Calculate engagement score = (likes + comments) / followers *100

Output:
→ Use Naas and Notion drivers to populate a Notion database.

And you know the best part? 

A Naas engine is on a schedule to keep the list updated every Monday.



Do you find this interesting? 

👍💬 Please feel free to share your thoughts in comments and tag amazing people that are not on this list 🤓



PS: if this post gets 1000 likes, we will take time to work on it more and integrate feedback + apply probably some ML in the process :)

PSS: if you want to support us for more such free content, you can sponsor the Naas project on GitHub (link is included on the page)

They don't know how to code.

0.5% of the world's population knows how to code, which means 99.5% don't know how to build websites and mobile apps..and I'm not even talking about data products.

Literacy on digital tools is a big deal.

Apparently, 18.5 million is the number of real ""developers"" or ""programmers"" according to a study from IDC.
I don't know how many women, neither how diverse it is.

But, it's like the population of New York City-Newark Region, having super-powers comparing to the rest of the world.🌎👑

Good news!
With the new generation of AI (NLP Transformer models), you can generate code by typing a simple sentence, soon it's going to be your voice.

Yet, if you don't know what or how to ask → You will not get what you want.
💩 Garbage in, garbage out.

You need to understand the basics of coding to be able to talk to the machines.



🎙 Join me live next Thursday to talk about it.
Coders and non-coders from everywhere, welcome!

It's going to be the first episode of Naas ""Open Source Office Hours"".

We are going to create a simple website in 30min and talk about HTML, CSS, Javascript, Python, AI, and Jupyter notebooks 😉⚡️

When you work on Excel, everything you do is by default to production.

You update your spreadsheet, you share it with your audience. 
That's it. 


→ But when you start working on data science projects, replacing ""Excel + VBA"" by ""Jupyter Notebooks + Python"" 

You NEED TO DO A LOT to push to production, and it can be quite complicated to:

🛑 convert your notebook to a python script 
🛑 deploy it to on a server 
🛑 set up a cron task to schedule it 
🛑 ensure security
🛑 make sure the whole ecosystem works together 

...when you actually want to focus on solving a business problem!


→ What if, instead, you could do that from your notebooks? 

With Naas notebooks, you can do that with minimum technical skills. 

You only need to master those 5 low code features: 

(1) ⏰ Scheduler 
(2) 🛎️ Notification 
(3) 🖼️ Asset 
(4) ⚙️ Webhook 
(5) 🔗 Dependency 


→ What are the benefits? 

Imagine you need to produce an analysis of Tesla's (TSLA) stock price, use ML to predict +20days lines, and deliver it by email every day automatically. 

✅ naas.scheduler.add(): run your notebook every day. ⏰

✅ naas.notification.send(): email the result (copy your users), add attachments if needed. 🛎️

✅ naas.asset.add(): share static and dynamic graphs 🖼️:

✅ naas.webhook.add: re-run the notebook by clicking on a link. ⚙️

✅ naas.dependency.add: isolate the content of your email from your code, so your users can modify the output easily 🔗

This is only one example. 

With Naas, you CAN DO A LOT, without headaches. 



👉 I created a template in the awesome-notebooks repository + a video (link in comment) to illustrate this. 

Just click on ""Open in Naas"" button to open the notebook (if you don't have an account, it creates one for you, and it's 100% free)
↓ 
Input your email
↓ 
Run the notebook. 

It will copy the notebook in naas ""⚡ → Production"" folder to be executed daily. 

↓ 
Do you find this useful? ... 

🙏 Thanks a lot for the support. 
💬 Comments are welcome, tell me what kind of use case you want to see next.

I really wanted to connect with all those minds, and what I learned was amazing. 


→ Like me, most of them got interested in data, automation, and AI, because they faced real-world problems they want to fix. ⚡️

→ They totally get what we are trying to do at naas.ai: making Jupyter notebooks production-ready to bridge the gap between tech and business teams 🙏

→ Ethical AI issues and explainability of the models are at the center of their preoccupation. 

They want to take a stand and correct the biases we currently face with this technology. 

(yes, most of the people coding AI models are male, white, caucasian or asian...and this is a problem! 🚨)

→ They understand that the power of AI is in making it available to the masses; and that NLP transformers models can help us get there.

→ Most of them want to get involved in projects, but only a few have started looking at Open Source!  

✅ So, I showed them how simple it was to become a contributor to Naas Open Source project with the awesome-notebooks. 🌱


As the world moves deeper into the Fourth Industrial Revolution, what is next for Africa in HUGE!

The continent’s entrepreneurs are taking advantage of this growth in connectivity to create tech hubs across the continent. 

This is fueling innovation...

and I don't see any reason why Africa can't have AI companies building AI solutions that serve the rest of the world.🌍🦄

Jupyter notebooks are awesome. 

You can write text and run code in the same document. 

It enables fast prototyping, debugging, and effective storytelling for your data projects. 

And, it provides a place for business and tech people to be literally on the same page!

Nonetheless, notebooks come with their own limitations, the most annoying ones being:

🛑 limited scalability, 
🛑 tendency to push developers to duplicate code,
🛑 lack of a standard structure.

Lots of articles, posts, and talks are talking about it: 

Joel Grus, in ""I don’t like notebooks"" 🤮, accuses notebooks of creating bad habits in developers and data scientists.

William Koehrsen suggests blaming sins 😈 and not sinners 😨 and proposes an interesting solution:

→ Creating a template. 
A standard yet flexible skeleton for every kind of Data Science notebook.

We came to the same conclusion as William with naas.ai awesome-notebooks templates 🚀

→ So we developed a template framework : 

Each notebook should be structured using markdown (text) with:

'''
# Tool - Action verb explaining the target
Description:  a quick summary of what the notebook does
Author: First Name, Last Name linked to a social profile
Tags: any relevant hashtag

## Input 
Import libraries
Add variables 
Data import 

## Model 
All the functions, a list of transformations applied to the input.

## Output 
Any kind of asset (data frame, graph, excel...) that needs to be consumed by the end-user.
 
👍 What are the benefits? 

✅ With a common skeleton, anyone can understand what's going on, and share it. Even non-tech people ⭐️
✅ The description allows the reader to decide whether to dive deep into the code or just run the notebook 
✅ With sections already there, you save time formatting and can focus on how to document.
✅ Refactoring relevant code and integrating it into a module or library (like naas_drivers) become easy
✅ With explicit naming conventions, it's simple to find what you are looking for...

+ BONUS: if the framework is respected, the awesome-notebooks Continuous Integration in GitHub actions make it available in the ""Templates"" section of the Naas manager automatically.

→ A few weeks back, Maximilian contributed to naas.ai awesome-notebooks template with an amazing demonstration of how a T5 model can be used. 

T5, or Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer, is an extremely large neural network model (11 billion parameters) that can perform any kind of natural language processing (NLP) task.

In our example, we used the Hugging Face API to get access to the T5 model.

The results were quite interesting...

""""""""
The idea is to cycle instead of driving a car.
	✅ Good idea
The idea is to always travel by plane.
	❌ Bad idea
The idea is to put your trash everywhere.
	❌ Bad idea
The idea is to put plants on all the roofs.
	✅ Good idea
The idea is to walk once every week in nature.
	✅ Good idea
The idea is to go buy Green bonds.
	✅ Good idea
The idea is to buy single-use items.
	❌ Bad idea
The idea is to drink plastic bottled water.
	❌ Bad idea
The idea is to eat a lot of meat.
	❌ Bad idea
The idea is to eat less meat.
	✅ Good idea

As Maximilian rightfully said T5 is like a child continuously learning.

Instead, think about the word ""TRIBE"". 🙏🤗

Yes. Like a TRIBE. 
A tribe is a group of people that share ancestry and cultures while living in their own enclosed society.

It may seem counter-intuitive at first. 

But I can assure you that you are on the same tribe as those end-users you want to serve. 

You may not speak the same language. 
They don't know how to speak to machines, you do. 

But you fall under the same umbrella: human beings. 

🚨 And the key for your project to be successful is adoption by those humans beings!


T.R.I.B.E is a brilliant framework that has been developed by Mark Freeman II to get from ideas to production in the smartest fashion. 


🥇 It is, to date, the best framework I encountered to bridge the gap between technical and business people.


Here is what it means. 👇

T → Talk to your stakeholders to determine their needs and pain points.

R → Build out your requirements at a high level by creating a brief analysis plan, data tables, and sketch out the MVP (Minimum Viable Product) output. It might be a report, an app, an email...

I → Iterate by going back to your stakeholders with your requirements to get feedback. Your MVPs, sketches, and plans move the project from abstract to tangible allowing your stakeholders to give you much better requirements.

B → Build your project to the best version possible with the time constraint given by your stakeholders.

E → Evangelize your project by being strategic on how to communicate the value proposition. Be bold, be broad, and encourage buy-in and long-term adoption. 

Also, by collaborating with stakeholders early (T and I) you are already starting the evangelize process and your collaboration with them creates ownership!



Here is a Livestream I made with Mark Freeman II where he talks about his experience as a data scientist working at Humu. 

He is also sharing how his thoughts process on a notebook analyzing his LinkedIn data. 

Watch the replay if you have time. 
It's full of very insightful tips and tricks. 

+ Mark is awesome 😉💚. He is currently working on very cool open source contributions on naas.ai

This is the story about a ""fight"" between Business and IT departments 🥊

When I started as a financial analyst, I never understood why any technical requirements involving the IT department was :
→ looking way more complicated than it seemed
→ taking way too long to be executed
→ never respected the deadline.

We mostly asked them to automate basic models running on Excel, like:
→ Extracting data from applications
→ Cleaning and merging datasets together
→ Creating an Excel spreadsheet with pivot tables and graphs
→ Sending it to our boss on a daily basis

Nothing fancy right? 
Yet, most of our queries ended up nowhere.

🤯 The IT department was answering this with a ""Pro-forma Business Requirement Document"",
that needed to be filled ASAP,
to end up in their backlog...
...and delivered
NEVER.

Why? Because:
(1) by the time we were done filling it, our needs would have changed!
(2) IT priorities were elsewhere, they were dealing with infrastructure, pushing major evolutions to Production.

Production?
Yes.
When you work with applications, you develop and test changes. You commit code to a repository to ensure version control (VC).
There, a continuous integration (CI) system can take this code and build it, to expose it on a server, used by the quality assurance (QA) team to do further tests, and eventually gives its green light to “push the code to production”!

= face the real world, the users.

Don't get me wrong, those processes are important.
But the problem is, most of the time they cannot follow the speed of business requirements that are changing very fast.

🚨 This is why we created naas.ai
And in this new update, we chose to expose the ""⚡️→Production"" folder used to schedule, expose, trigger actions inside Notebooks.

If you are an analyst, you can use it to automate all the boring stuff.
If you are a data scientist/software developer, you can use it to prototype and deliver to the business faster, and more...

This is the question I asked today to GPT-3. Keep reading 😉👇

It all started with a conversation with Axel, a contributor to naas.ai open source project. 

He wanted to know whether he should define himself as a Software Engineer or Data Scientist. 
...I tried to help him define the 2 to the best of my ability.

But the truth is...lines are getting blurry. 

With the new generation of AI (ie: the transformers models like #BERT or #GPT3), users may be able to develop their own AI applications.

🚨Does it mean that technical roles are out of the game? 
I don't think so, but I wanted to ask the AI itself using my GPT3 API access. 

👉 Here are the results when I used a simple ""Q&A"" task:

Q: What’s the difference between Software Engineer and Data Scientist? 
A: Software Engineers build software. Data Scientists build models.

Q: Will Data Scientists and Software Engineers will be replaced by Transformer models? 
A: No. 

Q: Why? 
A: Because Data Scientists and Software Engineers are not Transformer models.

👉 Then I designed a curated input from different Google search responses, and used the ""Summarize for 2nd grader"" task:

The first answer with limited words (called tokens) 

```
Software engineering is about creating the tools that let people create things, like video games. Data science is about using those tools to make the games better, like by making them run faster. Both are important!
```

The second answer with 300 words.

```
Software Engineering is a field of computer science that focuses on the development of computer applications and the features of computers. 

Data Science is a field of computer science that focuses on gathering, processing, analyzing, and extracting insights from data. 

Software engineers develop the programs that data scientists use to gather and process data. 

Data scientists analyze the data gathered by software engineers. Software engineers create programs that capture data and store it for data scientists to analyze. 

Data scientists analyze the data stored by software engineers.
```

If not, try it, it can do wonders.

Music is a certain arrangement of sounds. 

→ If you arrange sounds in a certain way, it will become noise.
→ If you arrange sounds in a different way, it will become music. 

There’s a whole lot of noise passing as music right now. 😅

I've always been fascinated by music since my childhood, and over the year I became my best ally to focus at work.

If you know something about classical music, you would see classical music involves an enormous amount of mathematic behind it.

There’s a structure.

A mathematical structure in which classical music is been built. 

As far as I am concerned, when I listen to classical music, it's like a shot of energy. I can get into a ""flow state"" where I can create better pieces of work.

In some way, music recreates creation in a sound form: a wave! 

With ups and downs. 
Like in everything in life.

Creation is just a complex amalgamation of sounds or reverberations.
Music is an attempt to imitate life in a different form.

Will people get healthy and well by this? Definitely, if you hit the right pitch 🙏

According to Accenture research, 66% of asset managers say that data management at their company needs to be completely disrupted.🌪

They need a “data reinvention”. 

A framework to develop their ability to analyze vast amounts of data, sometimes in real-time, to fuel growth, product innovation, and deliver world-class customer service. 

Yet, if you asked asset managers:
""Can you turn your data into an asset to achieve a competitive edge?""

...only a few would say yes

So, the stakes are high in getting data right.

Where are firms struggling regarding data? 

- Data fragmentation and disparate versions of “the truth” 
- Proliferation of data sources
- Rising costs of data management
- Lack of an enterprise data strategy

What should a firm do to transform data into a REAL asset?

→ Invest in the long term on three interconnected actions:

1. Business → Build a strong data foundation
👉 Create an effective data management program, which includes data governance, data quality and master data management; technology platforms and data architectures; and data supply chain management.

2. Technology → Harness advanced technologies
👉 Use artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning, and analytics to develop critical insights from data and micro-decision making.

3. People → Create a data-driven culture
👉 Manage the people and cultural dimensions/impacts of advanced data management.


This post is a summary of Accenture's report on ""The power of data-driven asset management"". 
See the link in the comments.

But it's by far the most powerful. 

Github is a web-based platform used for version control = to keep your code SAFE.

Git simplifies the process of working with other people and makes it easy to collaborate on projects.

Team members can work on files and easily merge their changes with the master branch of the project.

🚨 And yet, I meet a lot of people that do not know (or never had the chance) to work and see a full end-to-end Git workflow. 

Even worst, they are sometimes scared to use it because of the ""hardcore"" command lines you need to execute...and prefer the manual rename of their files to version their work 🚨

To be honest, I was scared too 😅

But you don't need command lines to use Git 😎

At naas.ai we started using the module inside JupyterLab,

it works just fine! 🚀

Our complete open source project workflow is now 100% relying on GitHub. 

- the roadmap 
- the issues => PR handling 
- the documentation 
- the onboarding of our contributors 
- the sponsoring (I'm the only sponsor for now though 😂)

==
Next Thursday, between 12 PM and 1 PM CET, I will record a 📺 Special live contribution with Aniruddha Kalbande for Fireblaze AI School on the Naas project. 

It will be a very simple one on our awesome-notebooks repository, but the idea is to focus on the COMPLETE WORKFLOW!

People in Canada, USA, all of Europe like France and Spain, Siberia, or Asia will probably not have to be convinced as new record has been crossed.

Global warming is here!

If we compare to COVID epidemic where we can put an economy in a slow mode in the name of good common good…

How can we explain that the spectacular climatic crises = no action at the global level?

We feel we have to do our part:

👉 In the coming weeks, we going to working again on public data to continue what we have started with #earthdatachallenge and World Situation Room.

👉If want to work on those topics with us, as part of the naas.ai opensource project, you are more than welcome. 


We will provide training, coaching, and love 💚

Feel free to reach out in the comment, and present yourself in a few lines. I will get back you👇 

PS: There is plenty of data projects to develop. It's a true opportunity to work on real-world data science examples that can have an impact.

Last Wednesday, we launched our first-ever Newsletter in 9 months. 

Yes, we completely missed out on producing a proper update of the project before that. 

But even then, our user base has continued to grow to reach +900 accounts opened in 45 countries.🌎

We listened carefully to user’s feedback, integrated them into our vision of the product and now, we feel like we are on the right track to make Naas the “all-in-one open source data platform” everybody needs.💚

In this release, all the users can now benefit from the latest version of Naas manager. 

And, the crazy thing is that, inside the product, you can now access all the awesome-notebooks template (synced with Github) in 3 clicks 🚀:
- Connect to Naas with your Google, GitHub, LinkedIn account 
- Go to the Naas manager from the launcher page
- Search for the template you need by tool, action, or #tag
- Press the “Open in Naas” button and you are good to go! 👉 The template opens in a few seconds. 

This smooth process is something we have been working on for weeks. 

We hope you will enjoy it!

Of course, there is much more in this newsletter: 
💎 New contributors that have joined the project
💎 New contributions validated
💎 Better Hubspot integration using LinkedIn drivers
💎 New user feedback on the integration with naas.ai and PowerBi
💎 New video from the last Naas talk about #DataOps

Feel free to share your thoughts and feedback on what we do. 

And if you don’t have an account yet, get started today, it’s free!

🙏 We're working hard to build Naas, and need more help! 
If you know anybody who would like to contribute to open source - in engineering, marketing roles, and more - please let us know and tell your friends!

👍👍👍👍👍 Thanks a lot for your support.

Do you know the US restaurant chain TGIF: ""Thanks God It's Friday""?

It's funny but quite true: most people suffer the week, and live for the weekend. 


But with all those things happening in the world, let's remember one thing: 

😃 We are here only to live. 🌱

Live 100% of the time, not 30%!

Only human beings think they are here for some other higher purpose. 

All other creatures know they're here to live.

For them, it means eating - sleeping - reproducing until their life is complete.

But as a human being, you can

- eat as much as you want
- sleep as much as you want, 
- reproduce as much as you want,

..and still, your life is incomplete.

This longing for something else is forcing people to pour ""spirit"" in their glass over the weekend 🍷 🥃

...by lack of spirit in themselves?


Of course, sometimes we need a break for some reason, or we simply like a nice glass of wine, that is perfectly fine.😉

But if we make this distinction between what is work and what is life, maybe it's because what we do is NOT LIFE. 


There is no such thing as work/life balance, in my opinion, there are only different dimensions of life. 

From the moment we are born till the day we die, only ☝️1 thing is happening: life! 


Do you agree? 👇
I'm curious about learning what's your plans for the weekend in the comment.💬

Enjoy your Friday, and your weekend everybody!

👉 5 things I learned from the Notion official ""🌟 What's New?"" page.

And how I tried to apply it to naas.ai by simply copying their framework.

It's been 9 months since we soft-launched www.naas.ai but we never actually found a way to write a proper newsletter. 

❌ We never found the right format (email? web page? twit?)
❌ We never found the right frequency (every time a new feature is released? weekly? monthly? bi-monthly?)
❌ We never found took the time to reflect on what we actually wanted to do. 

But 2 months ago, I started using Notion more and realized how simple and efficient their product updates were... 

👉 Here is what I learned from them: 

✅ Be short: try to limit it your updates in different and paragraph with only a few sentences each. 

✅ Tell stories: adopt a conversational tone to draw your reader in. 

✅ Focus on the reader: your audience is going to be interested in what you do to help them. 

✅ Create Call To Actions: make sure you’re asking your readers to do something with your content.

✅ Make it nice: the team at Notion is clearly focused on the design and this is why I used the same framework for Naas Product Newsletter. Why not copy the best-in-class? 

I hope this short post can help a few people. 

+ of course..that you will learn interesting stuff in this first ""REAL"" newsletter (🔗 the link is in the comment)

I would love to hear your feedback in the comment section 👇

Thanks a lot! 
Don't forget to share the open-source love 💚

And, have a nice Wednesday!

We are now ranked #84, 6 weeks after we started.

Read below if you want to learn more👇

Pioneer has been created by a former Apple director, Daniel Gross, who ran the US accelerator Y Combinator’s AI-track and launched the project as a global talent search fund in 2018/2019.

Pioneer is designed to remotely help determined and ambitious people take their project to the next level. 

After you submit your initial project description, you'll go through the Pioneer Tournament. 

You have to demonstrate weekly progress, vote on other participants updates

👉 and see where you stand on their global leaderboard. 🎖

Selected experts review players in the Top 50 on the Global Leaderboard and choose new Pioneers as often as every week

If you get selected you'll receive:

💎 Access to a network of elite founders.
💎 Free Stripe Atlas company formation.
💎 Mentorship from some of the world’s most successful individuals.
💎 Participation in the Pioneer Demo Livestream, which may help you fundraise.
💎 and credits on third-party providers like 100K$ Amazon Web Services (AWS) credits or Airtable

😍 The funny story is that we got contacted by Jackson Prince from the Pioneer team because one of the startups asked if Naas credits could be included in the package. 

We are not there yet but we started competing in the Tournament and it has been a very interesting journey so far. 

We improved our FOCUS because you need to commit every week to updates on at least 3 KPI's, talk with other founders...

+ you need to do a 1 min pitch video. And this is what I wanted to share today.

Your family 
Your children
Your friends
Your work 
Your money 
…

They all may be important.

But the most important thing is that you are alive!

It’s because you are alive that all those things are important to you. 

Do you know that every day, more than 150 000 people die ?

It means that at least 2 to 3 times more people lose someone that is close to them.

So if by chance tomorrow you wake up.

Put a big smile on your face.😊

If the people around you are still alive.

…even bigger smile 😃.

If at 9:30 you are still alive, another smile 😀.

And every time you check your clock ⏰ just do it! 😉 S.M.I.L.E 🤗

Because what you are looking at it not your clock, it’s your life ticking away ⌛️

If you think about mortality at certain times, it can make you depressed.

If you live with it all the time, being joyful will become your natural state 🙏


Do everything that you can do, to the best of your ability, live your life to the fullest. 

The most important thing in your life, is that you are ALIVE 💚 Enjoy 😉

Today, I am happy to announce that we are making the Naas FREE Plan 5X BIGGER

+ notebook uptime becomes UNLIMITED for all paid plans.

This move is the result of 252 days of iteration since our soft launch on Product Hunt in Nov 2020.

One of our key learnings is that notebook uptime should cost less to: ✅ let people use their credits for the powerful Naas low-code formulas and templates 
👉 so that they can build explainable data products that will make an impact.

🌎🖥 This will reinforce our mission to make data, automation, and AI accessible to all.

🌱 ✊ Nevertheless, we are still committed to lowering the energy consumption of your Naas engine without losing efficiency. 

💡 This is why we will still ""switch off the light"" when you are not around for 15min. 



Starting today, you can enjoy  ====> 16h40min per month of free notebook uptime (vs 3h20min) = 5X times more!

If you subscribe to any paid plan (Starter, Pro, Enterprise) notebook uptime becomes UNLIMITED!

Most of the data projects fail because they don't focus on delivering value to the business ASAP! 

Do you agree? ⬇

If you haven't noticed, the business requirements are always changing...

...FAST

...like ""REALLY"" FAST these days.

What is true today will not be tomorrow. 

If you are not familiar with the concept of #DataOps. It might be the missing piece of the puzzle.

👉 DataOps is a process-driven, automated approach to data delivery and analytics focusing on the value provided to the ===> business.

It uses the agile approach between data owners and technical teams to build data-centric assets for a company.

It borrows methods from #DevOps (focusing on delivering high-quality code faster) and isn’t tied to any one tool or technology. 🚀


👉 Jerome Gransac    🇨🇭🇬🇧 🇪🇺 is an engineer that has started his career Finance as a developer working close to the inglorious Bank traders.

He learned DataOps the hard way! 

Confronting his scripts to the expected returns of the business has been an eye-opener. 👀

After this experience, he became a DataOps advocate in different organizations and is today working for the International Committee of the Red Cross - ICRC  in Switzerland.

If you have started posting content on LinkedIn for some time, now you want to understand if it’s providing value to your audience.

…and if not, what you can change in order to improve it.

🍀Luckily for you, you are not alone.

Mark Freeman II has been there as well.

He watched and learned from the best content producer on the network.

✅ He posted regularly for a few months.

🔍And now, it’s time to zoom out and make the data speak!

Since he has been using Naas LinkedIn drivers, he managed to get insights he was not able to get before. 

👉One of which he found completely surprising.🚨

Join me on Thursday to discuss with him and learn about his shocking discovery.



We will talk about his journey and what it takes to analyze the content he produces.

If your #opensource project is just starting to see its first contributions, start by giving early contributors a positive experience, and make it easy for them to keep coming back.

========================
👷‍♀️🛠 Work In Progress at naas.ai 
========================

👈 Last Monday, we made our first community call with a small group of contributors. 

The idea was to communicate what each one was working on, and ask for help/guidance if needed.🙏

Once a PR is submitted on GitHub, the core team will do its best to validate it ASAP with detailed feedback. 

Because human interactions and feedback matter.

+ We also wanted to clarify what are the different types of technical contributions on naas.ai :

Type 1️⃣ is to create a template following the Naas notebook framework (input/model/output) so that anyone reading it knows what to expect. 
We call them the awesome-notebooks 😎
=> https://lnkd.in/g64ewPb


Type 2️⃣ would be to make python low-code formulas to make the templates more simple, and reusable in other contexts. 
We call them Naas drivers 🏎 => https://lnkd.in/gfjKdRt


Type 3️⃣ is for the ones willing to enter the core of the Naas engines. Working closely with us (the core team) on the product roadmap. 
We call them the Naas features => https://lnkd.in/gnySUZ7


🏅=> If you make at least one of your PR is validated and merged, contributors will be granted the status of  ""Opensource contributor"" 

= you can add Naas as an entity you worked for in your public profile, and we will back you up if you need any recommendations for future jobs. 


This is the commitment we make to the #community. 



👉 Next Monday, we are willing to open it up to more people. 

💬 If you want to join just comment and I will send the meeting link to you.


Spread the #opensource love 💚 as usual.

2 weeks ago during 📺 naas.ai talks, I had an amazing conversation with Khuyen Tran.
 
📚Khuyen is currently pursuing her degree in statistics and have been wanting to do something to apply her learnings. 

She began with data science but ""it didn't stick"". 😛

So, she started writing articles and found that it was sticking MUCH better.✏️

It became her routine!  

👉She got good feedback and benefit from this, but then realized that sometimes people don't have enough time to only read...

...so she decided to extract some small tips and created her website.

The tips are code snippets that she posts on LinkedIn and the plan is pretty simple: ""get access to the good stuff to progress in data science every day, in less than 1 minute""

She accumulated over 350 tips. 

For all the wannabe content curators and creators for the #datacommunity out there, Khuyen is the person to follow. 

I must say I'm very inspired by her work, and very happy we are planning to collaborate on Naas awesome-notebooks templates!

🚨Stay tuned.

Pioneer is a ""remote first incubator"" that helps founders track progress, get advice, and get funded created by Daniel Gross

Joining Pioneer perfectly aligns with naas.ai async + remote + opensource nature. 

It is also helping us learn how to ""build a company in public"" to: 
✅ Achieve greater transparency 
✅ Build trust in the brand
✅ Be more authentic and less self-centered 🧘‍♀️

It's already bringing a lot of value to the project because it forces us to stay focus on our goals every week.

📌 Last week progress update :

- Closing Q2 with: 719 users (+32% vs last month) in 45 countries

""""
Me: What is openAI? 

AI: OpenAI is a non-profit research company that was founded in late 2015 by Elon Musk. The company's goal is to further the development of artificial intelligence in a way that is safe and beneficial to humanity. 

Me: Is openAI good? 

AI: OpenAI is part of a growing consortium of leaders in technology and industry working to ensure that AI remains beneficial to humanity. This consortium considers AI to be one of the most important scientific and technological developments of recent times and it could help many people all over the world.

""""

Good start. Right?

👉Which is, by the way, nothing incredible compared to the technology we have inside our human body. 

❓ Why would we be afraid of something that is helping us focus on more important things? 

⛓ Unchain yourself. 

First, learn how to read code. Get familiar with the concepts. 
I suggest #python 🐍

Then, learn how to speak/write code!

I didn't know anything about social media or content creation when I started posting a few months ago. 

Then, I learned that it's all about 3 things: reach, engagement, and conversation.

🚀 Reach
...measures how the algorithm prioritizes your content 
=> to how many people your content has been shown.

+ 💚 Engagement
...measures the number of reactions that your content generates, but it's not that simple. 
=> time of day, geography, job are as much important! It's the “why” someone is engaged. 

= 💬 Conversation
...can be everything from a 1:1 chat, comment, share, an emoji, or even certain keywords
=> provide insight into how the member truly feels about content.

Humans need to realize what a machine cannot do and stop being scared of #AI! 

Human beings have MANY layers of intelligence. 

What we call ""intelligence"" (we should say ""intellect"") is only a small part of it.

👇
The big deal behind #ArtificialIntelligence is that : 
- accumulating information, 
- analyzing it,
- projecting it the way you want, at a given moment
...will no more be considered as a valuable thing in human faculty.

👉 So it's very important to understand, that :

#intelligence is an individual's ability to acquire skills, knowledge and apply them,

while 

#intellect is the faculty of objectively understanding and reasoning abstract matters.

Modern societies have given too much significance to the intellect
but #machines are better than us at abstracting things.

✅ So, we all must learn how to do things beyond our #Intellect!


🧘‍♂️ In the yogic system, the mind is seen as having 16 parts...Four are fundamental:
- Buddhi or intellect, 
- Ahankara or identity, 
- Manas or memory
- Chitta, which is pure intelligence, and if we manage to touch Chitta, we have access to the source of creation.

If you’re a new open-source contributor, the process can be intimidating. 😱

Yesterday, I posted 7 reasons why you should contribute, but let's be honest, it's not easy to get started.

You ask yourself so many questions like:
👇

❓How do I find the right project? 
❓What if I don’t know how to code? 
❓What if I do something wrong and break the software? 🤪
...

❌ Do not worry! 

There are all sorts of ways to get involved, but first, let's fix common errors.

1️⃣ You don’t have to contribute code
It’s often the other parts of a project that are most in need (project organization, communication, marketing). You’ll do the project a huge favor by offering these skills!

2️⃣ You don’t just have to work on software projects!
While “open source” often refers to software, you can collaborate on just about anything. There are books, recipes, lists, and classes that get developed as open-source projects.


✅ YOU could have a BIG impact on all sorts of open-source activities!

👉 Do you like planning events?
Organize workshops or meetups, conferences, hackathons.

👉 Do you like design?
Restructure layouts to improve the project’s experience, conduct user research or interviews.

👉 Do you like to write?
Start a newsletter for the project, or curate highlights on product updates, write about it on a blog

👉 Do you like organizing?
Go on the project roadmap and check for duplicate issues, suggest new issue labels for better clarity, ask clarifying questions on issues.

👉 Do you like helping people?
Answer questions for people on open issues, moderate discussion boards, or conversation channels.

👉 Do you like helping others code?
Review code on other people’s submissions, write tutorials for how a project can be used, offer to mentor another contributor.

Are you ready? 
👇

1️⃣ Improve the software you rely on
Lots of open-source contributors start by being users.
When you find a bug, have a question, you can look at the source to see if you can update it yourself.

2️⃣ Improve your skills
Whether it’s coding, user interface design, graphic design, writing, or organizing a project... if you’re looking for practice, there’s always a task for you.

3️⃣ Meet people who are interested in similar things
Open-source projects with warm, welcoming communities connect great people together. Many people form lifelong friendships through their participation in open source, online, or in person. 

4️⃣ Find mentors and teach others
Working with others on a shared project means you’ll have to explain how you do things, as well as ask other people for help. 

5️⃣ Build a portfolio that helps you grow your reputation and career! 
By definition, all of your open source work is public, which means you get free examples to take anywhere as a demonstration of what you can do.

6️⃣ Learn people skills
Open source offers opportunities to practice leadership and management skills, such as resolving conflicts, organizing teams of people, and prioritizing work. 

⚠️ And often, these skills are underrated!


7️⃣ It’s empowering to be able to make changes, even small ones.
You don’t have to become a lifelong contributor in open source. A typo somewhere? You can fix just that. 

Opensource helps people feel they can have an impact on their world, and that in itself is gratifying.🌏

Intuitively, most of us will think 🚀 productivity...

❌ Wrong answer.

A few weeks ago, I had the chance to talk with Carlos Toxtli for 1 hour about the future of work and the role of AI in the workplace during 🍹 naas.ai Happy hours.

Carlos is an HCI Researcher studying the Future of Work, he has been working as a Data Scientist, CTO, Tech Evangelist, Entrepreneur, Freelancer...

He has worked for some of the biggest corporations in the world Microsoft, Google, and even at the United Nations!


His vision of AI is based on human-centered design, a domain where human is at the center of everything.

When I asked him the question above, he answered :

✅ User Experience

""Of course, if we look at the computer every 30 min to get a response from an AI, it will be productive but it's not the approach that humans want""
👇
""Eventually, humans want to have a summarize result at the end of the day and work only 1 hour""


So, to all the wannabe #AI professionals out there, let's focus on the user experience:
👉 how the human wants to interact with AI
👉 how often they want this interaction to occur
👉 when they want to be alerted or prompted, when not.

They are a lot of things to consider in the workflow. It's not only about accuracy and productivity.

""If you understand how the user works, how much time he wants to invest on a given type of task, you will get the productivity you want at the end...""

World Environment Day is celebrated annually on 5 June. 

It is the United Nations' principal vehicle for encouraging awareness and action for the protection of the environment. 

But how can we actually measure the World situation? The World health? 

We are humbly trying to figure it out with a bunch of #datageeks. 

If you have been following the posts I have made recently with the hashtag #earthdatachallenge, it seems we found a way. 

👉 We created the ""World Health Indicator""
An indicator gathering other indicators and giving a score from 0 (worst) to 10 (best) on our planet's health.

And the below image the first output. 

If you want to know how we came up with this 1.79/10, the code is open-sourced here: https://lnkd.in/gwGVcf7

There are only 2 indicators so far: 

💉 COVID-19 Active Cases  = 0.21, with a weight of 4
🌊 Sea Level = 4.95, with a weight of 2 
...

We intend to add more but the only constraint is the time we can allocate to the project. 

We need all the help and support we can get from the #datacommunity. 

If you are working with data, python, notebooks, or just want to support, please show some 💚, comment, contact us & contribute!

Happy World Environment Day!

If you have followed me recently, we started a 1 month #earthdatachallenge.

The objective was to create and gather notebooks on the world open data to create a World Health Indicator.🌏 


I have been talking to a lot of people of that topic: 
✅ researchers, 
✅ journalists, 
✅ specialists in environmental issues, 
✅ data scientists, 
✅ people from big organizations like NASA of WHO, 
...and citizens from more than 10 countries willing to help.

All of them strongly encourage the project to go forward. 
+ Peter came out with a methodology for calculating the WHI. 👍

So, even if everything is not perfectly set up and organized 
even if we have only a few indicators ready to be integrated, 

👉 we are going to work tonight on the first version of the model.
Crazy? Probably.

Last month, with Peter Turner and a dozen of motivated data geeks, we started a #earthdatachallenge. 

👉 Objective? 

Gather notebooks on the world open data to create a ""World Health Indicator"".

We were supposed to end the challenge 2 days ago. 

❌ But it's not possible, we are not done yet!

The amount of open data, research papers, articles, graphs, infographics we have gathered is impressive and hard to decode when you are just a simple citizen.

You need help to summarize. 

You want to get the bigger picture before jumping into details. 


📺 Next Friday, during a LIVE session starting at 5PM CET, we will:

💎 share all the resources we gathered on world open-data
💎 start live coding the model that will help us build the World Health Indicator
💎 explain how we intend to keep working and improving it. 


Please 👍 and comment if you want to join and help us.

🎽 Next week naas.ai open-source core team is going to be trained, by a master: Denis Rothman.

Good training needs some preparation, so we are currently diving into his 3 books...
- Artificial Intelligence by Example 
- Hands-On Explainable AI 
- Transformers for Natural Language Processing 

 …and there is already so much value in there!

Since the very beginning of the book, I got completed hooked by how brilliant the Markov Decision Process is, and how clear it is explained.

I’m not coming from the technical side of the force, I’ve always been bad at mathematics at school…yet I understood what I read. 

When you bring explanations and real-life examples to the play (like the analogy of the car), it totally changes the way you learn. 

Here is the exciting quote that will summarize our learning journey:

""Being an adaptive next-generation AI thinker involves three prerequisites: 

✅ the effort to be a Subject Matter Expert (SME), 
✅ working on mathematical models to think like a machine, 
✅ and understanding your source code's potential and limits.""


Thank you Denis for bringing that knowledge to all of us in your books.

I can’t wait to start this training with you.

Yes, the agency is building the Orion spacecraft for human deep space exploration…

…but they also follow the indicators that can help us understand our planet's health. 


What are they?

1️⃣ Carbon Dioxide
Carbon dioxide levels in the air are at their highest in 650,000 years.

2️⃣ Global Temperature
Nineteen of the warmest years have occurred since 2000.

3️⃣ Arctic Ice Minimum
In 2012, Arctic summer sea ice shrank to the lowest extent on record.

4️⃣ Ice Sheets
Satellite data show that Earth's polar ice sheets are losing mass.

5️⃣ Sea Level
Global average sea level has risen nearly 7"" (178 mm) over the past 100 years.


✅ The data is well presented and well documented.
❌ Yet, if you want to extract the indicators data, it’s not that easy. 

You need to handle different sources and formats: TXT, CSV, Database.

No Machine Learning needed at this stage, no rocket science either, just some data mining:
- Find the source
- Understand the data 
- Build a notebook and focus on parsing and automating data access.

Citizen data science is a term coined by Gartner: a global research firm.

= a person who creates or generates analytics or predictive analysis, but whose primary job function is outside the field of statistics and analytics.
They refer to it as a “label” inside the business space. 

❌ No surprise why it does not appeal to a lot of people at first. 
👇 Another definition should be more popular.

Peter Turner is a Citizen Data Scientist, he lives in Cape Town, South Africa. He is a data scientist. 

✅ He defines Citizen Data Science as the fact of doing data for fun and for things you care about. 

Sometimes he writes articles on Medium on global data challenges. 
He enjoys surfing, motorbikes, diving/snorkelling, and running.

For him, good data science starts with a problem.

If you want to be successful, you need to hypothesize on something, and then try to disprove it. 

👉 At this point in time, where we have tools that nobody had for the whole story of humanity...

...there are a lot of opportunities for people to work on data, outside of the business space.

With the #earthdatachallenge, let's start doing it.

#earthdatachallenge


2 weeks ago, we were live with Peter Turner talking about ""Citizen Data Science"" during naas.ai Happy hours.

We launched a kind of ""free-style"" initiative on Earth Day = 🌏✊ The Earth Data Challenge. 


The idea 💡 ? 

Encourage motivated people to create notebooks with the open data available on different topics regarding:
- CO2 emissions 
- Energy consumption
- Natural disaster
- Endangered species

...they are a lot of subjects!

So, how can we gather all that?

=> Can we build an indicator that can evaluate our “earth health” base on multiple indicators?

Maybe we can do it. Here is how :
 
✅ Gather the notebooks contributions
✅ Consider the best-case/ worst-case scenario (0 is worst, 10 is the best)
✅ Weight the different indicators to calculate one
= the W.H.I. (""World Health Indicator"")

This way 'Earth Health' will always be a value out of 10 

E.g.  :
A = Carbon in Air = 3/10
B = Animals going extinct per year = 5/10

Lets say WA is 2 and WB is 0.5:

Then Indicator A = 2 * 3 = 6
and   Indicator B = 0.5 * 5 = 2.5

Earth Health = (10*(6 + 2.5)) / (20 + 5) = 3.4



👉 Do you think this can actually work?

Here is an idea: start contributing to Open-Source actively.


Open-source software (OSS) is code that is designed to be publicly accessible. 

There is an enormous opportunity to develop your skills and personal branding by being an « Open-source contributor » to an OSS. 

✅ Find projects or organizations that you are interested in.
✅ Go to their GitHub repository, website, read the doc, search for topics that you can achieve. 
✅ Join their Slack, Discord,...introduce yourself and ask for help when stuck. 
✅ Try to work on as many issues as you can for a period of time, don’t give up after 1 week.
✅ Once you are comfortable, propose improvements yourself! 


naas.ai is open-source, it brings Jupyter Notebooks to the cloud + micro-services (like a scheduler) accessible in « low-code ».

Naas is forever free to use with 100 credits/month. 

If you contribute to our library of open-source notebooks templates, you can X2 your monthly credits 🏆

#earthdatachallenge update, week 1.


With nothing to restrict us, the population has grown dramatically.

On current projections, there will be 11 billion people on Earth by 2100.

But it’s possible to slow, even to stop population growth well before it reaches that point. 

🇯🇵. Japan did it. 
As healthcare and education improved, people's expectations and opportunities grew.

…and the birth rate fell.

Their population has stabilized and nearly changed since 2000. 

It's happening in other places.

=> As nations develop everywhere, people choose to have fewer children. 

The number of children being born every year is about to level off. 

A key reason why the population is still growing is that we are living longer.

=> It means, we will reach a peak. 📈📉

The sooner this happens, the easiest it makes everything else we have to do:

✅  Raise people out of poverty
✅  Giving all access to healthcare
✅  Enable girls to make longer studies
...

The trick is to raise the standard of living around the world, without increasing our impact on #earth. 


👍  if you think we can do it.

(Earth data challenge update)

I first started building a data project without even realizing what it was, 10 years ago, as an intern.

I was lucky to work close to the ""big boss"" that wanted a simple question to be answered: 



=> “Do we have the right amount of cash in bank ?” 🏛 💰


I started from a blank page, asking questions, calling people in +30 countries to understand how they worked and what kind of data I could get. 

I finally ended up with a “model”.

Each entity would fill it to report the cash positions and flows by nature, by banks, week after week. 

With a few copy-paste in Excel, I was able to consolidate the data, and start answering questions emerging from the first one. ☝️


Today, we have better tools, but I still feel the same way.

“It’s still day 1”, and nobody expects you to solve a problem overnight.


Coming to the #earthdatachallenge, I ""think"" the question is : 

=> Can we build an indicator that can evaluate our “earth health” 🌏 ✊ ? 

To answer that, a lot of subjects need to be addressed. 
I guess this is the real challenge.



What subjects should we choose?

Today, I spent some time working on naas.ai to improve a script that we have already open-sourced: 

the GDP per capita and growth. 

GDP per capita and growth are very important when it comes to analyzing world data...but I will come to it in a later post.

Because what really bothered me today is the color scheme of that map. 

Colors are SO important when it comes to visualizing data. 
I think Kate Strachnyi ♕ will agree 😉  as she is writing a book about it.

Colors help you highlight the most important aspects of your message and simplify complex graphs. 

By using contrasting colors, such as red and yellow, if you're comparing two data sets, you can simplify data and help viewers to see the big picture. 

But when it comes to maps, you need to find a color scheme that will convey the right message. 

You don't actually want to put in heavy RED or GREEN the countries with low or high GDP value or ratio because it's seen as positive/negative.

I have an idea but I wanted to ask.

👉 What color scheme would you choose?

An annual event first held on April 22, 1970 to demonstrate support for environmental protection. 

= 51 years ago !

It now includes a wide range of events coordinated globally by EARTHDAY.ORG including 1 billion people in more than 193 countries. 

Scope of work:
- Climate actions
- Science and education 
- People and communities 
- Conservation and reforestation 
- Plastic and pollution

Open-data should be everywhere on those subjects.

❌But it’s not that easy.

We spent the whole day with my data mining students on the matter. 

Datasets available are :

- scattered around different organisation websites (OECD, WorldBank, NASA, FAO...)
- often raw so you need to clean them before using
- hardly up to date or on the right perimeter

If you are not sure let me develop 👇


🏛 In business, an asset is any resource owned or controlled by an economic entity.

It is anything that can be used to produce positive economic value.

Business assets represent the value of ownership that can be converted into cash 💰

=> when a #datageek writes a script for a business, he needs to deliver an output that will generate earnings or savings.


🌏 In society, an asset is also a resource. But it's not owned or controlled by one entity. All the citizens can benefit from it.

Society assets represent the value that can be compounded over time for future generations.

=> when a #datageek writes a script for society, we build an output that would benefit everyone; to educate, entertain, inspire.


❌ The problem is that it's not easy to deliver ""ready to use"" assets.
The cost of iteration is too high.


With naas.ai low-code formula ""asset"", you can generate shareable assets link to your audience in seconds.

So you can assert the value of what has been produced, faster.


PS: join us for the #earthdatachallenge2021 and let's produce value to society! More info in the comments.

Hey #linkedincommunity 

Hope you had a nice weekend!

Last Friday, I dropped a post here to launch an event on #earthday2021 (22/04), 

that will bring #datageeks together 

to build open-source #notebooks 

on our planet's #health 

=> This event is meant to last 1 month (until 22/05) to give participants the time to work on the topic they want. 

It is spontaneous, decentralized, open to all. 

🗓 Tomorrow: we will talk about it in more details with Peter Turner live on Google meet. 

Agenda: 
= 30 min discussion on the work he has done already on climate change and time series on Towards Data Science
= 30 min brainstorming on the way we can push the EARTH DATA CHALLENGE forward (we have a lot of ideas to share, bring yours 🙏) 

Here is the event page with the google meet link attached => https://lnkd.in/gkMjd7E


👉 Come and join us to build this project together!! 

PS : I will also be in the ∞ Ravit show on Wednesday to explain how naas.ai opensource project will support this initiative as much as possible.  Stay tuned ✊🌏

Over the past years, a few documentaries on climate change really increased my consciousness on the future of our home: Earth.

☝️ The one from ""David Attenborough: A Life On Our Planet"" really struck me because he narrates how : 
- Human population 
- CO2 emissions 
- % of wilderness 

evolved over his lifetime. 
A lot of very interesting (and also devastating) data in there, that could help us all understand our PLANET HEALTH.

As a data geek, I started looking online for data notebooks already published and I found Peter Turner's article on time series and climate change on Towards Data Science. 


I was completely hooked. 

I decided to contact him 10 days ago, we went on a call, our brains connected instantly. 🧠

We had a crazy idea. 


🚨As next Thursday 22nd of April is #earthday2021, what if we could gather a bunch of #datageeks like us for a #30dayschallenge to build open #notebooks about our earth's health? 


If you are interested => COMMENT! 


We will build this project in public and share progress here.

I also saw that Thomas Edison said something similar: “I have not failed. I've just found 10,000 ways that won't work.”

As AI is rising everywhere, redefining the future of work, we - as humans - need to learn how to work beyond our intellect, how to do what a machine will never be able to do. 

If you find this topic interesting, join us tomorrow for our Live naas.ai Happy Hours with Carlos Toxtli. 

He will present to us some of his projects on Human-Computer Interaction & the Future of work. 

Carlos is one of the most advanced researchers on this topic.

You need to UPSKILL.,"🚨 Spreadsheets simply won’t provide all of the answers you seek to deliver real insight from data. You need to UPSKILL.

If you are working with data in Excel everyday, you need to learn how to get things done with Python and Jupyter notebooks.

It will literally change your life. 
It changed mine and the one of many data professionals already.



Yes. You love Excel. Me too. 

You can model your business problems and answer questions with it. 

You can evaluate your sales pipeline, calculate margins, perform your daily treasury analysis and the list goes on and on...

You are an expert in pivot tables, formulae, charts or even VBA and PowerQuery. 

🛑 But before you realize it, your spreadsheet becomes a monster with tens of tabs, thousands of rows and VBA.

Nobody can audit the process….and it takes hours to update your reports (if your computer has not crashed in between)!

Sounds familiar? 

In exactly 24 hours, we are doing a live session at 5 PM Paris time with Dan Lester on the subject during naas.ai Happy hour sessions.

We will discuss why YOU should start using Jupyter Notebooks as an alternative powerful analytical tool.

👉 Comment if you are interested, I will add you to the event !

- It's just taking too much time for the audience to wait (you sometimes even forget you have commented) 

- It's taking too much time and it's mostly manual for the guy posting to send the assets (Shubham SHARMA 💡→ 🚀 Benoît Dubos 💎 Victor Vivès 💎...tell me if I'm wrong) 

As humans, we use technology to help us communicate faster, easier, with more people. 
We want instant interactions and information.

But for that to happen, the first step is to make technologies talk to each other.
👉 If you are working in the #data #nocode #lowcode spaces, you have probably heard about webhooks.

A webhook does stuff on its own when certain criteria are met or scenarios take place (vs API who does stuff when you ask it to)


📺  In this video, I'm seting up a webhook to get data from a form in naas.ai landing page to send an email automatically to the subscriber  with the asset.

In his early life, he was seen as the ""New World Teacher"".
He made a lot of quotes on intelligence and education.

Today I gave a talk about CashStory and naas.ai at Sorbonne Université.

I was really impressed by what I learned from the group of students: 

- Most of them has knowledge of Python 🐍 
=> even if it's not their primary field, it's part of their Master program (Corporate Treasury)

- 85% of them work on Jupyter Notebooks to run their scripts.

10 years ago, when I started, I got no choice to start learning on my own how to code to automate my work. Nobody told me about it at school.

Now it seems things are changing in the right direction.

The rise of automation and AI has caused the nature of work to shift, impacting industries of all shapes and sizes ...

The professionals who can provide in-depth, holistic finance and technical knowledge to power businesses will be key in the future of work.

Thanks a lot to Philippe HELAINE for inviting me to this talk. 
I can't wait to see the power this generation will unleash in the market.

48 hours ago, we were live with Denis Rothman on a fascinating show about the Transformers: the next generation of AI

Denis has been working on AI all his life, and he is now sharing his knowledge and philosophy on the subject. 

Take away: 
- Transformers today are invisible: they learn from the billions of posts, videos, images on the web
- They are managed by the biggest corporations in the world 
- Those corporations use our information for free and then they sell it back to us in other forms (nothing new but just a reminder)
- Transformers outperform the current ML/AI and human intelligence algorithms because they see patterns where we see none. 

BUT 
- They are just tools, we can learn how to use them to our benefits 
- The key is to understand, clean, prepare your datasets before running them 
..and cut your work into pieces to build accurate models.

Denis is an AI specialist, worked all his life on AI/ML, implemented many successful projects for retail and other industries.
=> He has written the first book ever on this subject!

We are going to explain what they are (spoiler: nothing to do Optimus Prime Autobots crew, yet) and focus on the challenges of using them to summarise texts.

Are you interested in joining? 

Just post a comment, I will directly send you to the calendar event link (Google meet)

I recently realized that the best content producers are planning their posts in advance.

Of course!
Writing a good post takes time. 

But once they are written, don't you want them to be sent at the date and time you desire automatically? 

This week, I built a use case on Twitter posts and tried to see if I could automate & schedule posts using www.naas.ai 

Twitter is one of the most popular social media platforms in the world.

BUT, if you want to build automation, you need to go through a form of 10+ questions before you get access to the API (Thibault Houdon 😅)

So we found a way to quickly set up an automation process by using IFTTT as a proxy + plugged a Google spreadsheet as a source. 

It's very easy for tech & non-tech to use this notebook template. 
I made 2 videos about it. 
This is the 2nd one with the full workflow. 

👉 Want to get the notebook template? 👍 in comments and I will send it to you. 
+ Don't forget to like and subscribe to the channel for more videos :)

Have a nice weekend.

Notion is one of the most popular ""All-in-one workspaces"" because of its excellent adaptability to any kind of projects/businesses.

""One tool for your whole team. Write, plan, and get organized."" is their motto.

#product​ #engineering​ #hr​ #marketing​ #design​ #sales​ you can customize it for any kind of jobs.
It can enable you to replace :
- Confluence
- Github wiki 
- Trello 
- Jira 
- Asana 
- Google doc
- Evernote 
...

BUT, there is a but, there is no public API (it's still in private beta). 
A lot of users in our community needed to read and write into Notion database from other tools. Shubham SHARMA 💡→ 🚀  Théo Rouland or even Mr Chris Messina in the US 😉

So we made it possible.
With few lines of low-code python formulas (we call them ""Drivers""), we made it easy for tech & non-tech users to access the data in less than 3 minutes 🥁

No technical configuration required. Just a little magic 🧙‍♂️

And we have seen it growing A LOT. 👶 

Three months marks an exciting time as you move out of the “fourth trimester” of the life of an infant. We feel pretty much the same for Naas. 

Your baby will be taking on a new appearance and gaining a lot of exciting skills at month 4 like finding their hands, smiling more, and perhaps the more important development of all sleeping through the night. 

Naas appearance has also improved, we listen to the feedback of our users and made it easier to :

- find the way to get started with the features => a better #onboardingprocess 
- develop more templates that will help us run the project on auto-pilot but also benefit the #opensource code base.
- build the future or the product with the community with our #happyhours session

In this last session, we talked about how Netflix inspired and validated the experiments we were making internally; who we are; what challenges we face; where we are going...

...and how you can speed up your data projects like crazy using our low-code formulas.

Je ne sais pas vous, mais moi, j'ai vraiment du mal.

- ça prend un temps fou de faire un texte sympa qui apporte de la valeur à ton audience
- l'impact n'est pas assuré. 
- et surtout, quand on gère une boîte, on n'a pas que ça à faire !

En plus de ça, c'est quasi impossible de récupérer ses statistiques facilement (nombre de likes, comments, views) sans être dépendant d'un outil externe...

...et à l'ère du ""data-driven everywhere"", c'est quand même un peu problématique.

Alors certes, c'est une super plateforme, qui te permet d'avoir de la visibilité, même si tout le monde ne s'appelle pas Grégoire Gambatto (en espérant que ce tag va servir à quelque chose) 😉

Mais, en gros, c'est facile de laisser tomber même si vous avez plein de choses à dire. 

Vous êtes d'accord ?

Avec naas.ai et l'équipe de CashStory, on est sur le point de trouver le moyen d'automatiser un petit paquet de tâches via des scripts python, et qu'on veut #opensource.

Du coup, je suis curieux :

Toutes sauf une: Netflix. Son secret? Les notebooks.


Le besoin de pouvoir utiliser efficacement les données n'a pas changé, mais au cours de l'année écoulée, il est passé au premier plan.

Pendant ce temps, le terme ""data-driven"" a commencé à être employé partout.

Le problème?

C'est que personne n'a vraiment compris ce qu'il signifie.

Pour comprendre comment construire une ""culture axée sur les données"", on a étudié le fonctionnement de Netflix: les BOSS en la matière.

De nombreux articles et vidéos sur comment ils opèrent sont disponibles sur internet.

Ce jeudi, 13h, on vous résume tout, en Français.
Nous allons décortiquer comment Netflix a mis en place une culture axée sur les données via un outil open source bien connu des #datascientists, les notebooks.

Since we launched Naas.ai 3 months ago on @producthunt, the core team has been working hard to build a credit-based pricing model.

This free plan gives you access to 100 credits per month (equivalent to 3h20 of notebook uptime).

Credits will be debited based on the services you use :
- Notebook uptime = 0.5 per min
- Scheduler = 1 per min
- Webhook/API = 1 per call
- Asset sharing = 1 per call
- Notifications = 3 per message

Next week on the roadmap, we will work on the ""Naas daily"" email.
In this daily brief, you will be able to check your credit consumption, be informed of the latest opensource templates released by the community of notebook lovers ❤️, get access to a curated list of articles on data topics.

This is a big achievement for the core team in our mission to make data, automation & AI accessible to all.

Comme Elias Orphelin, je suis gêné quand je la regarde 
car j'ai l'impression que l'objectif était juste de faire coïncider les pastilles bleues (couvre feu à 18h) avec les départements blancs (taux d'incidence plus faible).

Quand vous regardez un graphique ou une infographie (construite à la main), ne soyez pas dupe, posez-vous la question de pourquoi il a été construit.

La seul carte qui tienne c’est celle de la tension hospitalière.
= niveau de tension dans les services de réanimation, de soins intensifs ou de surveillance continue.

Of course, you are! But...
...if you are not a developer, you think it's too complicated.

It's time to reset your mindset because things are getting much easier now. 

We think Jupyter notebook is the most awesome interface to enable access to data, automation & AI to everybody. But one feature was missing to build these robots = Scheduling! 🤖

We searched for a solution and realized NETFLIX was doing it!
They are currently running +10,000 scheduled jobs daily on the Netflix Data Platform based on notebooks.

We integrated their work into Naas, so you can access their POWER 💪

👉 The scheduler feature of Naas is a low code formula, that will enable you to run notebooks 😴


Feel free to try it out on naas.ai

Start by being a data miner. 👷‍♂️👷‍♀️


So many people think that the “data field” is not for them because the term includes a LOT of things.

The role of a data science professional is a combination of :

- an AI researcher
- a deep learning engineer, 
- a machine learning engineer, 
- a data engineer,
- a data analyst, to some extent. 

And the people understanding all that are max 2% of the population.  

Being a data miner is about :
- finding useful information in a dataset,
- dealing with structured data,
- using simple data tools to do so (excel, a jupyter notebook and bit of python are the most commonly used)



Both data science and data mining play crucial roles in helping businesses in identifying opportunities & making effective decisions. 

But let’s stop putting “data science” everywhere.


Don’t label yourself as a scientist.

Be a miner, 
dig into the data, 
make your hands dirty, 

... and eventually you will find the gold nugget that will make you want to eat the rest of the plate !  🥇

It's always long and tedious to send personalized emails.

What about making it more efficient this year?

Sending email batches can be automated using Python and  Naas low code formulas, with :
👉 naas.gsheet : you connect to google spreadsheet where your contact list is
👉 naas.html : you generate rich HTML emails people will love to read 
👉 naas.assets : you expose a nice image/gif that will be included in your emails 
👉 naas.notifications + a basic ""for"" loop in Python 🐍: you can send emails to all your people!

You can use these techniques to send email batches for pretty much everything but we made this example special!

Spread love and attention to the people you love, they may need it more than even this year ❤️ ⛄️🎄
 



PS1: Keep in mind that using notifications from Naas is somewhat restrictive (50 emails/24h on free trial account). 

PS2: If you want to receive the template ==> Comment and I will send it to you!

When I was at school, everybody uses to laugh at me because I wanted to use Excel spreadsheets all the time...

to follow our music association treasury,
to plan our next event (understand Party 🥳🍾)
to make some calendar projections, 
to create forms and questionnaires 
...and eventually to make some math and calculations. 

But it's not because you CAN do pretty much everything with Excel, that you SHOULD 😛

Recently, new players came into the game like Airtable. 
You can store information like Excel but make it more visually appealing and easy-to-use with its different view types (grid, calendar, kanban, form). 

But when you want to take this data out to do perform data analysis, automation, ML, etc => a good python notebook will always be more powerful 💪 

So for today's video, let me show you how to extract data from Airtable with Naas drivers in less than one minute 😎

All the company needs at one point to bring different files together for analysis.
Those consolidation tasks are often done with copy/paste or old school VBA. 
They are NOT efficient and prone to manual errors. 

I spent hours searching for videos on Youtube but they are too long (10 min+) and difficult to apply in a business context. That's why we created this video.

In ONE MINUTE, we will understand how to read, consolidate, and share multiple Excel files for reporting purposes using Python. We will cover the basics of everything you need to get started using pandas and Naas notebooks.

There are no 100 ways to make your cash work for you. 
...and surely putting it under your bed sheet is not one.😴

You can : 
1/ Buy shares of companies
2/ Create your own 
3/ Invest in real estate or buy tangible assets

The idea is that those things will value over time.

Everything comes down to beating the ridiculous 0.x% your bank is offering for letting your cash in their hands while they make (big) profits out of it.

To win this game. You need to go down to the mine. You need data!

It's the most precious resource you have...but it's far from being easily accessible to the masses. 

That's why we created Naas.ai, we hope this open-source project will help anyone take back control of data and build confidence in the future.

...and we became #5 ⭐️ product of the day: what a blast!💥

Naas is the first Jupyter based data-science platform that allows you to schedule, run, and expose all the awesome things you can with notebooks.

For the past 4 years, we've been working with Jupyter to integrate our client's data projects into their production environment. But going from notebooks to prod is a tedious process.

So we dreamed of making Jupyter a safe production environment to make data access as simple as writing on a piece of paper.💭

Then, we realized that Netflix was on the same path! They are indeed betting heavily on notebooks to enable data access from engineers to business executives.
We share their philosophy and created Naas 📒 Notebooks as automated Services 🚀

We wish to make Jupyter notebooks a commodity for everyone who wants to build data intelligence, with no black box. Everything is open-source, and we created a set of awesome notebooks templates to kickstart your projects in minutes.

We would love to hear your feedback on Product Hunt!

I will talk about the launch of NAAS.AI
👉 The opensource data & automation engines that work for tech & business users 🚀


When I started my professional career 9 years ago in finance I discovered that data analysis did not look AT ALL like what I imagined = no « minority report » kind of dashboarding and analysis, no magic 🔮

My boss asked me to give him visibility on cash….via EXCEL. 
So I started digging but quickly found out that things were : 
1/ Not repeatable securely
2/ Not auditable and shareable easily
3/ Very heavy to run on my PC

After a few years, I started CashStory to try solving those issues.
👷‍♂️ I dug into a new universe: Data Mining.
🐍 I realized that with a few lines of Python and a Jupyter notebook, I could take any input data, write business logic in text and code it at the same place, explore data with graph libraries.

But a few features were missing, so with my team, we dreamed about a supercharged Jupyter Notebook that could facilitate scripting data and automate analysis for any kind of user.

Vous vous êtes déjà dit que ce que vous faites manuellement aujourd'hui pourrait être complètement (ou en grande partie) automatisé ? Moi aussi.

👉Il y a 9 ans, j'ai commencé avec des Excels que je devais faire remplir à des contrôleur de gestion, des trésoriers, pour remonter des données sur le cash et la prévision de trésorerie (nerf de la guerre #cashisking...surtout en ce moment 💰) 

Temps passé à analyser : 10%
Temps passé à produire la donnée : 90%

...il y avait peu d'options pour apprendre seul comment renverser la vapeur ♨️


Mais maintenant, il y a ""Le Data Mining pour tous"" ❤️
Notre premier programme de formation. On y a mit toutes nos connaissances et les techniques qu'on utilise pour faire nos projets chez CashStory.

Au lieu de vous vendre de l'AI à toutes les sauces, on va déjà vous apprendre à automatiser votre intelligence via un parcours ""Gamifié"" 🎮 .


On ouvre 100 places pour la promo de début Janvier!

Parceque je crois que ce qu'on fait avec l’équipe est de plus en plus utile !

Hier et comme chaque semaine depuis 1 mois, on passe notre jeudi midi de 13h à 14h en Webinar hebdo avec la 1ère promo de CashStory Education.

On partage nos trucs et astuces pour utiliser Excel en mode efficace et faire des tableaux de bord en 15 minutes...

On parle design thinking, raccourcis claviers, création de base de données,  slicers, chronologie, de pourquoi passer d’Excel à Python.

C’est assez magique les retours qu’on reçoit ❤️ 

""Je connaissais pas du tout, ça change vraiment tout niveau visuel et clarté""

""...j'adore les slicers découverts il y a qu'un an effet waouh garanti""

""Je découvre vraiment bcp de choses et ca va me changer la vie > Gain de temps XXL""

""arggh la chronologie et dire que j'apprends cela aujourd'hui ....""

""Pas gadget, très ergonomique plutôt que saisir des intervalles de dates ... Top !""

On a vraiment eu le sentiment de donner un sérieux coup de main !

Ils régissent notre vie en ligne, notre vie tout court.
Mais est-ce que toute l'humanité doit dépendre d'eux pour créer notre futur ?

NON.

Hier matin, j'ai eu la chance d'intervenir en tant que speaker pour la conférence ""Du Big Data au Smart Data"" de l'AFDCC Association des Credit Managers.
La CDO de Euler Hermes, Sophie Marot-Rémy a lancé cette phrase qui en dit long :

« Un robot contraint d'abord toute une équipe a bien structurer ses données disponibles et à les documenter ! »
Oui, ""contraint"" . 

Il faut commencer par ranger correctement ses données, et ça 
commence par un travail manuel, humain.

Arrêtons de croire que la connaissance sur le sujet est dans les mains des IT, dev, tech, geeks...ou autre ""magiciens""...

La donnée, l'automatisation, l'IA, ce n'est pas de la magie.

La donnée c'est mon problème, ton problème, notre problème à tous...

Si tu ne t'y intéresses pas...ton poste sera en danger.

Entrepreneurs, commerciaux, controleurs de gestion, trésoriers, consultants Finance & IT... étaient présents au webinar de lancement de notre première promo CashStory Education.

...Et ils ont exprimés pas mal de frustrations:

""On était limité par l'outil mais on était surtout limité en compétences""

""J'aimerai automatiser le travail de mon équipe, pour délivrer un service de meilleur qualité""

""Marre de passer du temps à copier mes analyses Excel dans un Word""

En gros passer moins de temps à produire, plus de temps à analyser!

...les inscriptions gratuites a notre programme de formation “Le data mining pour tous” 😉

Depuis Juin, nous nous attaquons au vrai problème dans les entreprises aujourd’hui : l’Education autour de la data et l’automatisation.

Car voila, faire pour les autres : c’est bien, glorifiant un moment, rémunérateur - assurément - mais au fil du temps assez frustrant. 😵 

👉 on créer une DÉPENDANCE forte à son prestataire de service ou à son client (ça marche dans les 2 sens) 

Or ce qu’on cherche au fond, c’est la liberté, l’autonomie et la capacité à s’améliorer chaque jour ! 

Si vous êtes intéressé par notre approche => un petit emoji ou un mot en commentaire
On vous contactera pour échanger 😇



PS: on ouvrira très bientôt la liste d’attente pour la formation de Janvier 2021.

Depuis 4 ans Cashstory agit en sous-marin pour automatiser les rapports de plusieurs entreprises, « grand comptes » et croyez moi, rien n’est simple 🙃🤿 

« On ne fait pas de la magie 🧙‍♂️ » 

On a apprit beaucoup de choses et affiné nos techniques en : 
- 🐍 Passant de Excel,VBA à Python pour automatiser de longues heures de production et de traitement
- 🧠 Apprenant à utiliser tous les outils de BI du marché 
- 👨‍💻 Développant une super app qui agrège les différentes suites d’outils dont on a besoin par projet : BOB notre « Back Office Bot »... je vous en parlerais plus bientôt...

...mais ce qu’on a surtout COMPRIS, c’est que les personnes que l’on rencontre ne se sentent pas assez formées, accompagnées, pour gagner du temps et être moins stressées. 🥵

Alors, on a ouvert en Août a 20 personnes une formation gratuite pour 3 mois ! Oui on est des fous 😜 On a prit le temps d’écouter tout le monde la semaine dernière et on a décidé de rouvrir 15 places.

❌ Ne crachez plus sur les écoles et formez-vous en continu ! ✔️

""Ce que j'ai appris à l'école ne m'a servi à rien"" 💣

🤦‍♂️ C'est toujours ""drôle"" de voir ou d'entendre des anciens élèves dénigrer les écoles de commerce !

💸 Alors c'est vrai que le modèle est discutable et coûte une fortune mais bon...
Il faut prendre du recul, les connaissances aquises dans le passé ne sont pas forcement adaptées à la réalité du marché, encore moins en cette période ! 

💡 C'est une histoire d'état d'esprit, on devrait se former tout au long de notre vie professionnelle.

🤯 Donc s'en prendre aux écoles ça fait le buzz et c'est assez facile (elle a bon dos l'école de la vie)...
...mais avoir l'envie de se former alors que l'on est en poste serait peut être plus... malin et constructif ?

🚸 Depuis tout petit à l’école, on nous apprend à ingurgiter une masse de connaissances phénoménale sans réfléchir.
A appliquer des concepts sans trop savoir pourquoi.
Il faut juste apprendre, bêtement, « par cœur » 💔

🏭 Mais voilà, arrivé en entreprise, on re-crée le même schéma et on se retrouve à faire des copié-coller sur Excel, à garder les mêmes process sans changer.

On peut se sentir inutile, pas assez bien équipé, accompagné, on devient complètement déconnecté, déshumanisé : de vrais robots ! 😥

Apprendre de nouvelles connaissances qui facilitent votre travail quotidien N'EST PAS IMPOSSIBLE.

🔨 On nous assomme de chiffres en continu mais quand prenons-nous le temps de nous poser pour prendre la mesure de cette crise dans sa globalité ?

🧘 La mission de worldsituationroom.com est de permettre au plus grand nombre de prendre conscience de la situation du monde. Nous nous basons sur les sources utilisées par les grands médias, organisations internationales et préparons, pour tous, des visuels simples et pertinents permettant d'y voir plus clair !
Nous avons lancé une bêta Vendredi avec 2 chapitres : Santé et Economie et espérons l'étoffer dans un futur proche d'un chapitre environnemental et démographique + un flux d'actualité.

🙏 Plus de 3000 personnes s'y sont connecté depuis son lancement Vendredi.
=> Aidez-nous à développer ce projet ! Diffusez autour de vous, inscrivez-vous à notre newsletter, taguez en commentaires vos contacts....tout est bon à prendre.

We are operating in the fog of war.

💻 For the past 10 days, we have been thinking with our team on how to contribute to the current situation...
...and as dealing with complex & foggy data is basically what we do, we created ""World Situation Room"".

🧘 We humbly hope to gather in this public application the world's data everyone should have access to.
This beta version focuses on health & economic data.

📈 This data changes rapidly, so what’s shown may be not be updated yet. 
+ COVID-19 confirmed cases aren’t all cases. They only include people who tested positive. Testing rules and availability vary by country. 

Still, we all should be able to clearly see what 's going on. Right ?

Help us lift the fog.
Share, contribute, stay safe.
