To schedule your Jupyter Notebook using Papermill in naas.ai, you just need to add this simple formula👇.

import naas
naas.scheduler.add(cron=""0 * * * *"") ← this cron argument is the standard syntax worldwide. It means every hour in that case.

Press play ▶️ and your notebook will be sent to the Naas ""⚡️Production folder"".

Every time your notebook is executed, a record will be stored in this folder so you can access it if it fails.

Why do we use IPyWidgets?
We wanted to create a form to set up tools directly in a notebook instead of having an extra step by using tools like Google Sheets Forms or TypeForms to get information from business users.

So, we associated markdown text and IPyWidgets to create the form directly in a Jupyter Notebook and the result is pretty clean. 😎

- do it because we needed to follow our own content
- build it in public to show how Jupyter notebook Project Jupyter and naas.ai can be used to create data products.

🤔 Let’s suppose you are working on a project with several outputs (database, charts, etc..).

👉 Rather than working on a single Jupyter notebook, you can split your code into various notebooks and create a “PIPELINE” notebook to execute your workflow with the '%run' Python 🐍 magic.


It allows you to: 
✅ make your notebooks more readable.
✅ test and validate each notebook independently.
✅ order your pipeline execution.
✅ add new steps in no time.

The challenge was both to:
- Create a product that could be useful for anyone who wants to follow their social metrics
- Build up a data product with only the knowledge of Jupyter notebooks Project Jupyter and naas.ai.


Today, we almost completed V0 on LinkedIn. 
Below is what you can get so far for your LinkedIn profile and company page:

🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Evolution and list of connections/followers by month.
📈 Number of posts published, views, likes, comments, engagements, and engagement rate by month.
🌟 Top-performing post, top fans (people who engaged the most with you) this month.
✋ New fans by post to engage in a conversation based on their interest.
☀️ Views reach by weekday and hours to catch your best posting timing!
And much more…

Remember that, this product will be open-source and FREE to use! All your feedbacks are more than welcome!

If you want to know more about it, please like or comment or connect with me directly 🙏.


We are organizing an event about it. See you soon!

If you work with Python, Plotly is the best library to create a nice chart!

The problem is that examples in the documentation do not provide chart business ready for companies. (Jérémy Ravenel 😉)
You need to improve it by adding:
➡️ A white background
➡️ A title
➡️ A legend
👉 And what about adding your company logo?


Once your graph is created, add the function `fig.add_layout_image()` and set the parameters:
✅ Add your logo URL in `source`
✅ Setup your logo size in `sizex` and `sizey`
✅ Play with the parameters `x` and `y` to display your logo on the top left corner.


Here is the documentation to dig in: https://lnkd.in/e3eU-JHK

Are you scared?,"What are you waiting for to start data science? Are you scared?
The truth is…


I was scared too. I knew it was an important thing to do in my career but I didn’t know where to start… Luckily I had a brother Jérémy Ravenel to help me succeed.
Here are the tips he gave me to get started:

✅ Focus on achievable goals
Start working on a simple project that matters to you. Split the project into steps, and appreciate each time go to the next.

✅ Organize your idea before doing anything
For this, I suggest using the simple framework we use at Naas: Input/Model/Output

✅ Google everything
You can literally ask “How to read excel in python?” and start from there (sorry my dear 🇫🇷 compatriot, it works best in English).
No need to have prior knowledge of any programming language.

✅ Use Jupyter Notebook Project Jupyter, the most popular data science interface
→ Before, there was only Anaconda distribution, on your computer (some tech setup required)
→ Now, there is naas.ai, on your browser (no setup required) 🙈😇

Naas comes with a bunch of templates that are ready to use, so it’s even easier to start now.
Check out the link in the first comment,
and let me know what you think?

Thanks a lot 🙂🙏🏻

If you work with Python, DateTime format is your best friend!

With a simple date, you can analyse your data weekly, monthly, quarterly, and beyond.

Mastering it can help you grow your business remarkably. But to achieve it, you need to know how to manipulate it.

I personally spent time learning by myself with the help of many stackoverflow forums. Today, it is time to share some tips about Python with you. 👇


First you need to master d3-time-format in Python.
To do so, I learnt from this useful GitHub documentation https://lnkd.in/e3U3HXVz. We will learn that “2021-31-12” is “%Y-%m-%d”

Then, simply use the formulas (notebooks template’s are available in first comment):
- to convert a string date to a datetime object to another string date : strptime(date_string, current_format).strftime(new_format)
- to convert pandas series to datetime series to another datetime format : df[col_date] = pd.to_datetime(df[col_date], current_format).dt.strftime(new_format)

Did you know this?

Feel free to share other tips! I am always happy to learn 😄 🙏

And there is a simple way to do that.

Here is how :

I have been working on data science projects for 5+ years, without even knowing it.
I switched from Excel to Python to fix some problems I had, tested a lot of things, failed a lot of times.

But I also learned that it’s not about coding, it’s about organizing ideas.

Here is a simple framework that worked every single time.
👇

-> Define your inputs clearly
List the tools you want to use, how to access them, what are the specific part of the data you want to get.
-> Think about how to model
Define the rules / transformation you want to apply to your data.
-> Design the outputs
A table, a graph, an Excel spreadsheet or an email...think very precisely about what is making sense for you or your audience.

In short, if you work with data, keep this framework in mind :
- Input
- Model
- Output
It will help you see clear and stay focus!

In a next post, I will show you a template on NBA bets done by one of our community members.

I’m going to try posting more regularly so if you want to support : any like or comment is welcome.⚡️

See you!

PS: I’m not alone in this data science journey, the project I’m working on (naas.ai) is about making the field much more accessible to anyone.

Pour l'avoir fait en tant que trésorier d'asso, je devais attendre de recevoir le courrier pour saisir les flux dans un Excel, l'enfer…

Aujourd'hui, pas mal de choses ont changé, mais il faut toujours :
- récupérer son identifiant, mot de passe, et autres codes envoyés par sms selon le niveau de sécurité
- se connecter sur sa plateforme bancaire
- trouver le bon endroit où l’on peut exporter ses données
- une fois trouvé, on ne peut souvent pas récupérer beaucoup de données d’un coup…
- et quand on finit par récupérer cette donnée elle ne ressemble à rien 🤮 !

On continue donc de passer des heures sur Excel pour enfin y voir clair…

Vous êtes d’accord qu’on ne devrait pas avoir à galérer comme ça 🛑 ?

Des solutions existent pour récupérer ces données (via API) et automatiser son analyse (via Python et les notebooks).

Avec mon frère Jérémy Ravenel (qui s'y connait ""un peu""), on a bossé sur une masterclasse gratuite pour vous partager nos tips et techniques.

Elle sera découpée en 4 sessions sur le mois de Janvier.

- faire des tâches répétitives 
- passer du temps sur une tache sans valeur ajoutée
- finir tard (et louper les happy hours 🍻)

Alors, je me suis mis à automatiser mon travail.
J'ai démarré sur Excel, puis VBA et enfin Python 🐍

Evidemment, je n'ai pas appris ça tout seul, il a fallu :
- de bons mentors*
- beaucoup de recherches sur internet
- et plus de 4 ans de mise en pratique chez CashStory

Aujourd'hui, toute cette expérience et méthode, on souhaite la partager avec vous.

C'est pourquoi, on a décidé de créer notre parcours de formation.

Au programme : optimiser l'usage d'Excel, passer d'Excel à Python, scripting sur des Jupyter notebooks (utilisé à 99% dans la data-science).

La première promo a déjà commencé et ils en sont très heureux 🎓 !

Hâte de rencontrer les suivants !

Avec mon équipe, nous avons l’habitude de travailler
avec des données compliquées pour les rendre simples et accessibles à tous.
Nous avons remarqué que les données sanitaires et économiques n’étaient pas
regroupées dans un même endroit. 
 
C’est pour cela que nous avons lancé la semaine
dernière, l’application publique : World Situation Room
https://imf.to/WRSFR .
 
Le but est de donner accès au plus grand nombre à des
informations diffusées sur les différents canaux. Nous les regroupons et nous
les restituions de manière simple pour tous.
 
Avec plus de 3 000 visiteurs en 2 jours et grâce à
vos nombreux retours, nous allons continuer à faire évoluer ce projet avec
vous.
